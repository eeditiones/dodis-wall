               reflecting on conversation) who stressed he was very conscious of his NATO colleagues
               concerns.</p>
            <p>2. Senior USA personnel with whom we spoke here last week, including Seitz<note xml:id="e4602">Raymond G. H. Seitz (1940), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57399">dodis.ch/P57399</ref>, Assistant Secretary of State for Europe and Canada in
                  the US Department of State 1989–1991.</note>, placed heaviest emphasis in creation
               of Two plus Four on overriding need to decompress situation for USSR. It is political
               need of USSR to show inside USSR they are, as USA put it, participants in unification
               process as it affects USSR interests and not its victims. The substantive point is
               that no one does really know how things will turn out a year from now in Germany,
               where public opinion is volatile. This probably accounts for some of reluctance you
               note in para 5 your telegram<note xml:id="e4608">Not located.</note> to establish
               fixed game plans. In circumstances, all acknowledge that any assets contributing to
               confidence and stability need to be sustained.</p>
            <p>3. Canadian military presence in FRG is expensive and increasingly and rightly
               subject to skeptical scrutiny from cost point of view. We are told by many in West
               (and East) that Canada’s presence is valued politically. If so, this needs political
               reflection in consultative will, USA in particular should acknowledge Canada’s
               presence as significant.</p>
            <p>4. Obviously changes will come in role of NATO, as well as in NATO comprehensive
               strategy. We are looking at possibilities regarding institutional evolution with more
               than open mind; we believe we shall have serious contribution to make. Baker ref to
               CSCE in his letter to Woerner<note xml:id="e4615">Manfred Wörner (1934–1994), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57417">dodis.ch/P57417</ref>, Secretary General of
                  NATO 1.7.1988–12.8.1994.</note> and Clark and others is important sign of
               increasing USA thought being given in Washington DC to CSCE (Seitz had commented to
               us here that USA acknowledges it has repeatedly “been a month or so behind everyone
               else” on evolving role of CSCE and would correct this tendency) and a welcome
               invitation to discuss CSCE organization and future effectiveness, both in NATO and
               bilaterally, which we shall take up.</p>
            <p>5. As to actual NATO force deployment, and comprehensive strategy, and Canadian place
               in ref to them, full range of possibilities also obviously exists, and nothing is
               pre-ordained. Defence review will look at these.</p>
            <p>6. In sum, your points A-D in para 6 are all sound. As to wise men idea, it is good
               one. Another idea possible complementary, would be to get back to ministers only no
               holds barred NATO discussions a la Sapiniere. In addition, UK High Commissioner<note xml:id="e4625">Brian Fall (*1937), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57474">dodis.ch/P57474</ref>, British High Commissioner in Ottawa 1989–1992.</note>
               here tells us they are mulling over proposing revival of a buddy system to radiate
               content of Two plus Four outward to others in NATO. We do not think we would like
               that, preferring close bilateral consultative relationships with all of five as SSEA
               letters propose. But fact that we are other North American force presence in Germany
               would indicate that if there were a basis to be buddies on an issue, this would be
               basis on naturally close consultative relationship with USA.</p>
