            <p>2. At a reception at the Aspen Institute at 5.30 p.m. local yesterday, a young
               colleague of the governing mayor confided in Head of Chancery<note xml:id="e799">Donald Lamont (*1947), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57479">dodis.ch/P57479</ref>, Head of Chancery, British Military Government, Berlin
                  1988–1990.</note> that a year ago, he took the view that the Wall would remain
               beyond the year 2000. Now it could be down in as little as five years, he thought. A
               few minutes later, the former Governing Mayor, Diepgen<note xml:id="e805">Eberhard
                  Diepgen (*1941), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57478">dodis.ch/P57478</ref>,
                  Mayor of West Berlin, 1984–16.3.1989.</note>, commented in a speech that what had
               been inconceivable a few weeks ago, might well be conceivable tomorrow.</p>
            <p>3. Neither had any inkling that as little as two hours later, the city would begin to
               buzz with rumours that travel from East to West was now unrestricted.</p>
            <p>4. Within hours of Schabowski’s<note xml:id="e815">Günter Schabowski (1929–2015),
                     <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P56902">dodis.ch/P56902</ref>, member of the SED
                  Politburo and spokesman of the GDR government 1989.</note> comments, broadcast on
               television, hundreds of East Berliners were queuing at the sector crossing points.
               After some initial uncertainty, the GDR border guards began to let them through. No
               special documentation was being required. The guards seemed content to put a stamp in
               an ordinary identity card.</p>
            <p>5. Later, crowds began to gather on the Western side. There seemed a possibility of
               trouble breaking out. And the Governing Mayor<note xml:id="e823">Walter Momper
                  (*1945), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57440">dodis.ch/P57440</ref>, Governing
                  Mayor of West Berlin 16.2.1989–24.1.1991.</note> who was at a crossing point in
               the British sector telephoned the minister in some concern. Head of Chancery, with my
               chief of staff<note xml:id="e829">Geoffrey van Orden (*1945), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57481">dodis.ch/P57481</ref>, Chief of Staff of the
                  British Sector in Berlin 1988–1990.</note> and two members of BMG<note xml:id="e835">British Military Government.</note> public safety branch therefore
               made a tour of some of the key points in the early morning.</p>
            <p>6. At 2 a.m. they found the Governing Mayor mingling with the crowds at the
               Invalidenstrasse crossing point. The Head of the Senat Chancellery<note xml:id="e840">Dieter Schröder (*1935), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57480">dodis.ch/P57480</ref>, Head of Chancellery of the Senate of Berlin
                  1989–1991.</note> was euphoric and incredulous. “A wonderful morning” he
               proclaimed. And he spoke emotionally of seeing two GDR guards, two West Berlin police
               and two members of the Royal Military Police talking together and cooperating in
               controlling the large crowds. A constant flow of East German Trabant cars was passing
               into the west of the city. They were warmly greeted by West Berlin spectators, many
               of whom spilled eastwards across the sector boundary without any reaction from the
               GDR borders guards. Indeed the guards here were beaming, visibly enjoying their new
               role of shepherding happy East Berliners in both directions across the crossing
               point. Several of the East Berliners waved palm leaves from the windows of the
               cars.</p>
            <p>7. A little distance away, groups of two or three GDR soldiers could be seen by the
               wire. They were no doubt wondering what function they were now expected to
               perform.</p>
            <p>8. I spoke to the Governing Mayor at this point and found him much more relaxed and
               confident that matters were under control. He was in jubilant mood.</p>
            <p>9. The Brandenburg Gate at 3 a.m. presented an amazing scene. Some hours before, some
               young West Berliners had climbed on to the Wall, which is broad and flat-topped at
               this point. The GDR guards had turned a water jet on them. But the intervention of
               some people in civilian dress on the Eastern side put a stop to this. And eventually
               as many as 600 young people were on top of the Wall, bathed in television lights,
               mostly quietly enjoying the unique occasion, and occasionally shouting “the Wall must
               go”. Some were chipping at the Wall with hammer and chisel and distributing pieces to
               the crowd.</p>
            <p>10. At Checkpoint Charlie at 4 a.m., several bare-headed GDR guards faced a friendly,
               jostling crowd. The ground was littered with the glass from broken bottles, and the
               guards sensibly closed the gates until the area could be cleared. They moved the
               crowd of West Berliners back to the sector boundary in a calm, gentle and skilful
               way.</p>
            <p>11. Television interviews with East Berliners testified to the fact that most were
               spontaneously testing whether the restrictions had indeed been lifted. A common goal
               was the “Ku’damm”, West Berlin’s main shopping avenue. At 4.30 a.m., it was lined
               with East German registered Trabants. And on the pavements, throngs of East and West
               Berliners mixed and greeted each other with obvious emotion.</p>
            <p>12. Though some of last night’s visitors had proceeded to Marienfelde refugee camp,
               most seem to have gone back. The Senat met in an emergency session last night and the
               Governing Mayor appeared on television to urge East Berliners not (not) to visit West
               Berlin immediately, but to spread their visits over the next few days. Allied
               ministers will meet with the head of the Senat Chancellery at 11.30 a.m. (local) and
               will have to consider requests for help. The Allied <emph>kommandatura</emph>
               <note xml:id="e858">The governing body for the city of Berlin following Germany’s
                  defeat in the Second World War, comprising representatives of the USA, USSR, UK
                  and France.</note> will convene this afternoon.</p>
            <p>13. We stimulated the Americans (who are in the chair) into producing an Allied
               statement welcoming this historical step. Text will follow.</p>
            <p>14. This morning at 8.30 local an estimated 3000 East Berliners were waiting at the
               Invalidenstrasse crossing point. The GDR authorities have made clear that proper
               documentation will be required. We have seen no sign of any difficulties at the
               crossing points so far. The atmosphere on both sides remains friendly and
               cooperative.</p>
