               has put himself – as so often in the past – in the vanguard of a development that has
               been recognised as unstoppable. He is acting from the conviction that he will only be
               able to influence further developments between East and West Germany if Moscow no
               longer seeks to slow down the course of events. However, Gorbachev’s support is
               surprisingly clear. While not unexpected, it is more the logical conclusion of his
               view that the German Question remains open and is thus the culmination so far of a
               development apparent in his comments since November 1989, as well as in

            <p/>
            <p n="1">Gorbachev is acting now because – like Shevardnadze in his article in
               “Izvestia” – he wants to largely steer and tangibly influence the discussion on and
               organisation of a CSCE Summit. He is making use of the short period before
                  Ottawa<note xml:id="e3403">The Open Skies conference convened on 12 February 1990
                  in Ottawa, Canada. It was the first large scale international conference after the
                  fall of the Berlin Wall.</note> to lend impetus to the discussion in the West. At
               the same time, he is addressing the Soviet public with the aim of gaining support for
               a historically inevitable and increasingly urgently needed solution to the German
               Question. This latter aspect is very important for Soviet domestic policy as regards
               underpinning foreign policy. The clear show of support for Modrow<note xml:id="e3406"
                  >Hans Modrow (*1928), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P54796">dodis.ch/P54796</ref>,
                  Chairman of the GDR Council of Ministers 13.11.1989–12.4.1990.</note> and the fact
               that the Party of Democratic Socialism (PDS) has now recognised German unification as
               necessary make Gorbachev’s comments helpful for this affiliated party’s election
               campaign. His critical subtext denouncing destabilisation attempts should be
               understood in this context. In protecting Modrow, he is simultaneously avoiding any
               connection with the future fate of the PDS. Gorbachev is explicitly addressing
               Germans in both East and West, thus reflecting Shevardnadze’s positive conclusion in
               the “Izvestia” article and trusting the Federal Government to live up to its historic
               responsibility for peace and stability in Europe. Moscow is already developing
               positions for its dialogue with both German states after 18 March.<note

            <p n="1">1. In view of German unification, which Moscow regards as inevitable, this
               process must be guided. That is why Moscow cannot afford to abandon the classic
               instruments (Four Power responsibility; enemy state clause<note xml:id="e3422">The
                  term <orig>enemy state clause</orig> refers to Article 53, Article 107 and a
                  half-sentence in Article 77 of the Charter of the United Nations of 26 June 1945
                  by which the signatory States can take enforcement action directed against renewal
                  of aggressive policy on the part of an enemy state (including military
                  intervention) without special authorisation of the UN Security Council. Enemy
                  states are defined <orig>as any state which during the Second World War has been
                     an enemy of any signatory of the present Charter</orig> (that is, primarily
                  Germany and Japan).</note>) now. In the future, we should continue to expect
               Soviet warnings against unilateral and destabilising measures aimed at the GDR and in
               relation to our European neighbours (no automatic incorporation of the GDR, no
               interference in internal affairs and a clear stance on the border issue).</p>
            <p>In view of these signals from Moscow, we should take the following into account:</p>
            <p>– The Four Power rights are important for the position of the three protecting powers
                  <emph>in Berlin</emph> even if developments between East and West Germany are
               likely to improve the city’s situation independently of these rights. However, their
               original purpose of safeguarding <emph>peace</emph> in and around Germany has now
               been <emph>superseded</emph> by <emph>other</emph> instruments.</p>
            <p>– Shevardnadze’s reference to the enemy state clause as a <emph>peacekeeping
                  instrument</emph> is equally obsolete. As regards <emph>peacekeeping,</emph> the
               Four Power rights and the enemy state clause only make sense if there is <emph>a
                  threat of war.</emph> As neither German state poses such a threat, these two
               instruments are not applicable.</p>
            <p>– Shevardnadze’s linking of the Four Power rights, the Charter of the United Nations
               and the CSCE process is something <emph>we</emph> can turn around and use for
               ourselves in the following way. If the Four Power rights and the UN are not current
               issues because there is <emph>no threat to peace,</emph> then they are at best a type
               of insurance policy for purely hypothetical cases, thus leaving the CSCE as the only
               truly relevant instrument for <emph>shaping policy</emph> rather than preventing
               war.</p>
            <p>2. The Soviets will therefore attempt to steer further developments in German
               politics at the CSCE Summit. This is the only framework that enables Moscow to make
               use of developments in Germany for its primary interest in pan-European
               unification.</p>
            <p>We, too, should determine the course of the CSCE Summit in light of German policy
               aspects. In giving us the right to self-determination and the possibility of peaceful
               change, the HFA<note xml:id="e3437">Helsinki Final Act of 1 August 1975.</note>
               provides us with enough prerequisites for German unification. It would be in our
               interest to state in a Summit document that Germany’s development must be embedded in
               Europe’s. This would simultaneously commit all Europeans to German unification.
               However, we should not tie this to a strict schedule so that the strong momentum in
               German development can continue speeding up European integration to the same extent
               as before (locomotive function).</p>
            <p>In order to create a politically meaningful connection that is also
                  <emph>flexible</emph> as regards the concrete development of relations between
               East and West Germany (synchronisation), it seems sensible to expand the CSCE
               process, including a certain amount of institutionalisation.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <title type="doc">IV.</title>
            </p>
            <p/>
            <p n="1"><emph>1.</emph> The German Question is one of Moscow’s most important
               instruments for <emph>influencing</emph> European development in view of the changes
               in the Warsaw Pact partner countries, the unstoppable withdrawal of Soviet troops
               from Central Europe and recognition of the dramatic economic emergency in the Soviet
               Union. With regard to the CSCE Summit, Moscow will thus try to make greater use of
                  <emph>us</emph> as an <emph>engine</emph> for <emph> pan-European security
                  structures.</emph></p>
            <p>– Moves towards closer relations between East and West Germany and German unification
               will be fostered by progress in West-East relations/arms control and economic and
               political cooperation. Germany’s interest in the first of these points is thus useful
               with a view to the Soviet interests in the latter.</p>
            <p>In this regard, German interests are a possible “catalyst” for developments that
               could be of benefit to the Soviet Union. We should develop this element in our own
               interests and highlight it. This would also be a logical continuation of previous
               constellations in which both German states played a part in arms-control achievements
               via their alliances. We still have this constellation. It will remain as a positive
               factor for West and East <emph>in</emph> the process <emph>and after</emph>
               unification of the two German states.</p>
            <p>– At the same time, the Soviet Union will endeavour to find common interests with
               other European countries that could form a counterbalance to developments between
               East and West Germany. (It is likely to continue trying to avoid unilateral
               dependencies when it comes to safeguarding its interests). In this way, Moscow can
               use the German Question as a lever with our western partners in order to achieve a
               “soft landing” in terms of time in the changed relations between East and West
               Germany.</p>
            <p>2. As regards protecting our own interests, this means putting German unification at
               the heart of plans for the future Europe. As the “heart of European security”
               (Shevardnadze’s article in “Izvestia” on 18 January), Germany fosters the
               transformation of the alliances in a cooperative security structure. Our aim of
               political integration between all Europeans is thus coming closer to being achieved.
               We should therefore encourage Moscow in its firm belief that only a united Germany
               will be a key factor for stability and the pacemaker for Central and Eastern Europe’s
               economic and social development.</p>
            <p>Gorbachev’s “big move” shows that in light of developments in the GDR (and other
               Warsaw Pact countries), he has decided between Shevardnadze’s two views of changes
               between East and West Germany, that is, a “catalyst” or a “destructive factor”. Only
               a course that uses the momentum of German developments for peace and stability in
               Europe, rather than opposing them, will foster the Soviet Union’s security interests
               and role in shaping events. At the same time, this move creates new “coordinates” for
               our policies. We will need to integrate the effects of Gorbachev’s decision on the
               direction to take carefully in our policies on Germany and the <emph>West.</emph></p>
