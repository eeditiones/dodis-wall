               <emph>Purpose of the memo:</emph> for information</p>
            <p>1. In contrast to the Italian media, the Italian Government has reacted with marked
               coolness and reserve to the events of recent weeks in Germany.</p>
            <p>The only official statement has come from the Farnesina, which expressed the hope on
               10 November 1989 that “the German people can be the main player in all future
               decisions”. The topic was discussed in the Italian cabinet for the first time on the
               evening before the European Council in Strasbourg after Deputy PM Martelli<note xml:id="e2780">Claudio Martelli (*1943), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57421">dodis.ch/P57421</ref>, Deputy Prime Minister of Italy
                  23.7.1989–28.6.1992.</note> had publicly criticised the lack of an official
               Italian position during his visit to Bonn.</p>
            <p>2. PM Andreotti’s repeated comments on the German Question in newspaper interviews
               have thus attracted a great deal of attention. He has primarily expressed concern
               about a threat to the delicate balance of power in Europe and the political future of
               Soviet President and party leader Gorbachev<note xml:id="e2788">Mikhail Gorbachev
                  (*1931), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P31707">dodis.ch/P31707</ref>, General
                  Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 11.3.1985–24.8.1991, Chairman
                  of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union 25.5.1989–15.3.1990 and President of the
                  Soviet Union 15.3.1990–25.12.1991.</note>, whose fate he sees as tied to a
               balanced and gradual solution to the German Question in a pan-European framework. His
               divergence from the generally more positive assessment by the Partito Socialista
               Italiano (PSI), but also by Democrazia Cristiana (DC) itself, has thus become
               clear.</p>
            <p>Following the sudden opening of the Wall on 9 November 1989, PM Andreotti did not
               comment on issues concerning the future of the two German states, but instead urged
               people to “keep their nerve”. Regardless of the dramatic changes in the GDR, he
               reiterated his view in several subsequent interviews that the question of
               reunification was “not current”. In fact, he regards the concept of “one nation – two
               states” as becoming current “in the foreseeable future”. (Most recently in an
               interview with “Corriere della Sera” on 26 November 1989).</p>
            <p>Fundamentally, PM Andreotti is one of the politicians who called at an early stage
               for the reform processes in Central and Eastern Europe to be regarded as a positive
               development that should be encouraged. His clear reservations regarding the German
               Question is thus all the more striking. However, it is not surprising if one recalls
               his comments in 1984, when he said “there are two German states and there should be
               two in the future” and warned about “pan-Germanism”. He has never retracted these
               comments.</p>
            <p>Following the meeting of the European Council in Strasbourg<note xml:id="e2800">For
                  the conclusions of the European Council on 8 and 9 December 1989 cf. <ref target="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/media/20580/1989_december_-_strasbourg__eng_.pdf">www.consilium.europa.eu/media/20580/1989_december_-_strasbourg__eng_.pdf</ref>.</note>,
               PM Andreotti (“La Stampa” of 12 December 1989) spoke of the Germans’ “right – hope
               would be a better word” to reunification. Here, too, his inclination was to play down
               the German Question. Commenting on the terms “self-determination” and “German people”
               in the European Council Conclusions of Strasbourg, he said that he had argued for the
               use of the term “free expression of the people’s will”, explaining that the Germans
               had “not clarified” at the start of the discussion “whether they were also referring
               to the millions of Germans living in Russia, Poland etc.”. Although this
               interpretation may have served to back up his previous comments, it is not
               particularly well-disposed towards the Federal Republic of Germany in the light of
               our bilateral relations, which are otherwise characterised by trust.</p>
            <p>In the pan-European context, Andreotti expressed his concern that the term
               “self-determination” could boost separatist tendencies, especially in Yugoslavia.
               Concern that the South Tyrol conflict could flare up may be behind these
               comments.</p>
            <p>3. In contrast to PM Andreotti, other Italian politicians – including some from DC,
               but primarily from the Socialist Party – have commented more positively on the German
               Question. During his state visit to Algeria on 12 November 1989, President
                  Cossiga<note xml:id="e2810">Francesco Cossiga (1928–2010), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P55266">dodis.ch/P55266</ref>, President of Italy
                  9.7.1985–27.5.1992.</note>, who is himself a member of DC, expressed understanding
               for the “Germans’ legitimate desire for reunification”. Foreign Minister De
                  Michelis<note xml:id="e2816">Gianni De Michelis (*1940), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57415">dodis.ch/P57415</ref>, Italian Foreign
                  Minister 22.07.1989–28.06.1992.</note>, Deputy PM Martelli and party head

                  the Italian Socialist Party 1976–1993.</note> of the PSI, and even Partito
               Comunista Italiano (PCI) head Occhetto<note xml:id="e2828">Achille Occhetto (*1936),
                     <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57424">dodis.ch/P57424</ref>, Secretary-General
                  of the Italian Communist Party 1988–1991.</note> have expressed fundamental
               support for respecting the right to self-determination. On 5 December 1989, Martelli
               accused PM Andreotti of having his head in the sand if he regarded the German
               Question as not current. Foreign Minister de Michelis has expressed similar
               views.</p>
            <p>4. Despite PM Andreotti’s reservations, however, the basic consensus in Italian
               politics regarding Central and Eastern Europe should not be forgotten.</p>
            <p>Italy is pursuing a policy of realism and pragmatism that sees stability in Europe as
               the main goal. That is why it believes the German Question can only be re solved as
               part of a general process of bringing West and East back together. In an interview
               with “La Stampa” on 12 November 1989, Foreign Minister de Michelis expressed support
               for speeding up “vertical integration” in the EC, while continuing “horizontal
               integration” in Eastern European countries. He said that flexible mechanisms must be
               developed in order to integrate these countries step by step through association.</p>
            <p>Upholding the Helsinki Final Act is as important to Italy as the EC aspect. The
               borders are fundamentally inviolable, although in an interview on 12 November 1989 de
               Michelis referred to the possibility of reviewing the border agreement through
               East-West consensus within the framework of the CSCE process. However, the Italian
               Government and public are concerned that the turbulent developments in the GDR and
               other Eastern bloc countries could cause instability in the Soviet Union and
               undermine Gorbachev’s position. By reacting cautiously, the West hopes to help
               counteract the fear in the Soviet Union that the West alone will benefit from the
               spectacular transformation in Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
            <p>5. We can assume that the European Council in Strasbourg succeeded in allaying the
               Italian Government’s concerns in this regard. As far as Italy is concerned, the
               agreement that the Intergovernmental Conference will start during Italy’s Presidency
               in the second half of 1990 and the wording on the German Question in the conclusions
               mean that the German Government will be involved in the EC integration process. Even
               PM Andreotti declared in a statement to the press after the cabinet meeting on 15
               December 1989 that he completely identifies with the European Council conclusions,
               which he said he had played an active role in drafting.</p>
            <p>However, it must be noted that despite the fundamental consensus between Italy and
               the Federal Republic of Germany on security, West-East relations and European
               integration, we still have plenty of work ahead of us as regards persuading the
               Italians on the German Question. German unification is naturally not a key Italian
               interest and tends to be met with underlying reserve by some sections of the Italian
               public. PM Andreotti’s sceptical stance is symptomatic of this. Rome in particular is
               keeping a close eye on possible German leadership in the West-East process, not least
               because Italy has high economic hopes of its own as regards development in Eastern
               Europe.</p>
            <p>Italy’s concerns about Germany should be countered by extensive information and
               prompt and close coordination at bilateral and European level, as was the case at the
               European Council in Strasbourg. Ambassador Ruth<note xml:id="e2846">Friedrich Ruth
                  (1927–2016), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57425">dodis.ch/P57425</ref>,
                  Ambassador of the FRG in Rome 18.11.1986–29.2.1992.</note> plans to hold talks
               with PM Andreotti on further developments in Germany and Europe as soon as possible.
               It would also be useful to continue the dialogue with Italy on further developments
               in Central and Eastern Europe at a high political level via an official visit by
               Foreign Minister Genscher<note xml:id="e2852">Hans-Dietrich Genscher (1927–2016),

                  and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the FRG 1.10.1982–17.5.1992.</note> to Rome in
               the spring. We should also press for the next German-Italian intergovernmental
               consultations to be held as soon as possible in Rome. The talks could take place in
               the early summer of 1990 in order to discuss this topic at the head of government
               level.</p>
