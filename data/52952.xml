            <p>1. Comments by Foreign Minister Arens on German unification during his visit to Bonn
               on 15 February<note xml:id="e4463">According to a press release by the Federal
                  Foreign Office of the FRG, Arens assured that after 45 years of democracy he had
                     <orig>full confidence in the Federal Republic of Germany and its democratic
                     institutions as well as in the advocacy of freedom and human rights expressed
                     in the Freedom Revolution in the GDR, and thus would have complete trust in a
                     united Germany. </orig>Translated from German from: <idno>Political Archive of
                     the German Federal Foreign Office PA/AA, B 7, Bd. 178982</idno>.</note> have
               been criticised by the Israeli press and particularly vilified in the two
               best-selling dailies.</p>
            <p>In an editorial, “Maariv” speaks of “national insanity” and “moral bankruptcy” if the
               Foreign Minister of the “state of Holocaust survivors” welcomes reunification,
               expresses his trust in German democracy and so clearly signals his support for “the
               creation of the prerequisites for a Fourth Reich and a new Hitler<note xml:id="e4468">Adolf Hitler (1889–1945), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P535">dodis.ch/P535</ref>, Führer of the German Third Reich 1933–1945.</note>”. Today’s
               edition (Schnitzer<note xml:id="e4474">Samuel Schnitzer (1918–1999), Israeli
                  journalist and editor of <orig>Maariv</orig> 1980–1985.</note>) reminds readers of
               Greater Germany’s abuse of power. “Even if we are unable to do anything to prevent
               reunification, it is our duty …. to warn and remind people how Nazism was able to
               emerge from a democracy in Germany, which we … can no longer believe after we had to
               pay with six million lives.”</p>
            <p>“Yedioth Ahronoth” (Ben-Orat<note xml:id="e4479">Probably Yeshayahu Ben-Porat
                  (1927–2007), Israeli journalist and political commentator at <orig>Yedioth
                     Ahronoth</orig>.</note>) asks who gave Arens permission to “now give our
               blessing to the creation of a Greater Germany” and to throw away “free of charge and
               with nothing in return the final trump card of our stance on reunification in the
               game against our European partners”. The paper writes that Israel’s position on the
               German issue is a matter for the people. Before commenting on this issue, there
               should have been an in-depth debate not only in the Knesset and with the Israeli
               public, but also with Germans and all Europeans. “Not a single day passes when they
               do not spit in our faces, insult us and vilify us”. However, they need Israel for one
               thing – “as moral legitimisation for German reunification”.</p>
            <p>The tone is much calmer in other newspapers. “Haaretz” (Schweitzer<note xml:id="e4484">Avraham Schweitzer (1923–1991), Israeli journalist and member of
                  the editorial board of <orig>Haaretz</orig>.</note>), the third-largest paper,
               rates the visit as actually “pretty positive”, as it proved that “Israel’s policy on
               Europe must be based on Germany”. “Germany, particularly its western part, is no
               longer suspected of being like its fathers and grandfathers in Auschwitz, but
               nevertheless it has not earned the right to have people loudly proclaim their trust
               in it.” Today’s comment is even more positive: The Foreign Minister “did well in
               leaving his interlocutors in Bonn in no doubt that Israel will continue to follow the
               events in the Federal Republic and the GDR closely in order to see if Germany remains
               conscious of its historic responsibility and acts accordingly”.</p>
            <p>The union newspaper “Davar” writes that the Federal Republic “has proven in word and
               deed its willingness to atone for the sins of the Third Reich”. Neither world Jewry
               nor Israel can prevent reunification, it says. However, Israel can take action in two
               areas. Internally, it can put pressure on the German education system to ensure that
               “the lessons of the Holocaust continue to be taught” in a united Germany. In terms of
               foreign policy, it can work towards Germany renouncing nuclear weapons, supporting
               peace efforts in the Middle East and providing generous support to reconstruction and
               development projects in the region.</p>
            <p>“Al HaMishmar” (Mapam<note xml:id="e4491">Political party publishing the <orig>Al
                     Hamishmar</orig> newspaper.</note>) describes the unavoidable reunification” as
               “unbearable from a Jewish point of view” because it will boost Germans’ pride,
               influence and self-confidence, “the characteristics that led to mistakes and sins in
               the past”. It writes that the Federal Republic has done a great deal to atone for the
               sins. Given the terrible extent of the Holocaust, however, the debts can never be
               entirely paid off.</p>
            <p>The “Jerusalem Post” comments today that the attacks on Arens can only be understood
               as emotional reactions. The Foreign Minister did not give his blessing to German
               reunification. He merely expressed the hope that a united Germany would uphold
               democracy and remain aware of its duty to the Jewish people. Weak democracies,
               including the Weimar Republic, fell prey to totalitarianism. “Israel’s role here is
               clear. It must use its moral power to ensure that Germany remains democratic, liberal
               and vigilant against signs of totalitarianism. … As a state, Israel must endeavour to
               make this nation its ally and friend.”</p>
            <p>2. According to newspaper reports, some cabinet members (Likud Environment Minister
                  Milo<note xml:id="e4498">Roni Milo (*1949), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57441">dodis.ch/P57441</ref>, Israeli Minister of the Environment 1988–1990.</note>,

                  Communications 1987–1990.</note>) have distanced themselves from Arens and are
               calling for a debate on German unification. After Arens and his deputy Netanyahu<note xml:id="e4516">Benjamin Netanyahu (*1949), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57443">dodis.ch/P57443</ref>, Israeli Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs
                  1988–1991.</note> return, this debate is scheduled to take place in the Knesset at
               the start of next week. Moda’i explained his stance to me yesterday by saying that
               there had been absolutely no need for comments, as the course of events could not be
               changed and there was no cabinet decision and thus no government view.</p>
            <p>3. Over the weekend, a visibly stricken Arens tried on television and in newspaper
               interviews to clarify the comments attributed to him. In “Maariv”, he pointed out
               that most of his family had perished in the Holocaust and that he would “never visit
               Germany as a tourist”. However, the Federal Republic was now a large power with
               democratic institutions in which he had utter trust. “Naturally, one cannot free
               oneself from the terrible memories, … but as Foreign Minister I ask if that means we
               should break off relations with Germany”.</p>

            </p>
            <p>After weeks of increasingly rational reporting and discussion in Israel on German
               unification, the pendulum has now swung sharply towards the emotions that the
               Holocaust has indelibly branded in the hearts of its victims and their descendants.
               The pendulum hits Arens less as Foreign Minister than as the main candidate so far to
               succeed Shamir<note xml:id="e4532">Yitzhak Schamir (1915–2012), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P54271">dodis.ch/P54271</ref>, Prime Minister of
                  Israel 20.10.1986–13.7.1992.</note>, an effect that is certainly not unwelcome to
               many in view of the long-standing dispute on who will take over as leader of Likud.
               The misunderstanding that the Israeli Foreign Minister has given a moral seal of
               approval to German unification was partly caused by over-interpretations by the
               German press and the fact that he made these comments in Bonn. The same statements in
               Israel (see reference telegram) (initially) had no adverse impact on Arens.</p>
            <p>We can hope that the debate which has now been sparked will not lead the Knesset and
               Government to adopt a negative stance on German unification, but will instead return
               to and thus strengthen the more moderate path of recent weeks, that is, not to forget
               the past, which also involves a loss of trust in the legacy of Weimar democracy, and
               not to give a moral seal of approval to a united Germany, but – despite all emotional
               resistance and fear – to hope for and foster a continuation of the democratic path
               and of the Federal Republic’s policy that is aware of the past.</p>
