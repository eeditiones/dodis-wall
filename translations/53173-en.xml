            <p>1. An analysis of the current phase of German-German relations shows that the
               reunification process is being influenced by:</p>
            <p>– election results in Lower Saxony and North Rhine-Westphalia;</p>
            <p>– after a monetary and economic union is introduced: expected social and economic
               problems in the GDR and a scarcity of democratic (and, to a degree, party) structures
               in the GDR, which supports the argument for the current German government to push
               through a programme of absorbing the GDR pursuant to Art. 23 of the FRG
               constitution;</p>
            <p>– Mr Kohl<note xml:id="e5713">Helmut Kohl (1930–2017), <ref

               federal elections rather than later ones;</p>
            <p>and external factors such as:</p>
            <p>– no objection from the three western powers against rushing the reunification;</p>
            <p>– pessimistic outlook for developments in the Soviet Union (to complete before the
               possible fall of Gorbachev<note xml:id="e5725">Mikhail Gorbachev (*1931), <ref

                  Union 15.3.1990–25.12.1991.</note>). The Soviet Union’s position has been
               noticeably weakening; Shevardnadze’s<note xml:id="e5731">Eduard Shevardnadze

                  of Foreign Affairs of the Soviet Union 2.7.1985–26.12.1990.</note> position on
               future roads to Germany’s unity is considered to be little thought-out and giving
               Kohl the green light. Taking Germany out of NATO is absolutely ruled out, which is
               why next steps from the Soviet Union are being anticipated. All actions by the USSR
               are being widely commented on (pulling out troops from the GDR and halting talks on
               conventional arms reduction).</p>
            <p>2. After the initial period of close relations among the four powers, a slightly more
               cautious approach to reunification issues could be discerned among the western allies
               (mostly France and the UK). The allies are starting to grow uneasy about the Kohl
               government’s policy of faits accomplis which partially takes the form of forcing
               support on the western allies. Nevertheless, the three western allies are not afraid
               of Germany’s rising importance because of the interconnections within the EEC and
               NATO, which they consider durable. Opinions are being increasingly often heard about
               the West’s lack of confidence in the success of M. Gorbachev’s policy of domestic
               reforms. That is why it is deemed sound to keep up the rapid pace of Germany’s
               reunification process, while highlighting the fact that we are transitioning from a
               bipolar system to a new one which will feature Germany in a prominent posi‑ tion.</p>
            <p>In the view of the three powers, the situation in Eastern and Central Europe (the
               breakup of a political alliance and the economic collapse) has set the actors free
               from the post-war community of interests with the USSR on the German issue. These
               superpowers are more interested in the breakup of the next eastern alliance, i.e. the
               Warsaw Pact, and in Germany’s entering NATO structures than in irritating its German
               ally. That is also connected with fears of a possible tilt in strategic balance to
               the east, were Germany to have a neutral state status.</p>
            <p>Interestingly, in contrast to their governments’ official positions, representatives
               of the three superpowers in W<add type="edition">[est]</add> B<add type="edition"
                  >[erlin]</add> do not hide their concerns and doubts about the implications of
               Germany’s reunification when speaking off the record.</p>
            <p>3. Given the view of the three western allies as well as the main political and
               social forces in the FRG, GDR and W<add type="edition">[est]</add> B<add
                  type="edition">[erlin]</add> , the Polish diplomatic offensive has led to securing
               our interests with respect to the border on the Oder and Neisse rivers. Currently,
               though, the infrastructure of treaty relations and economic cooperation are gaining
               particular importance. Examples could include actions of the USSR, which was quick to
               open talks with Bonn in order to protect its economic interests under its existing
               cooperation agreements with the GDR. Our country might face a number of problems not
               only stemming from the monetary and economic union between the FRG and GDR, but also
               the associated creeping disintegration of the GDR economy. Additional difficulties
               will be involved in the introduction of the EEC internal market in 1992, also
               covering the GDR.</p>
            <p>That is why in the “2 + 4” talks and in bilateral talks with the FRG and GDR, the
               Polish side could deem this element an important component of Europe’s wider security
               and cooperation system and the foundation of a future European home. On the whole, it
               is a main direction supported by all the interested parties, including Germany. It
               could also be a factor in mitigating German economic expansion.</p>
            <p>It is not clear yet what Germany’s approach to Poland will be like in the future,
               especially in light of the anticipated polarization of public opinion and attitude
               towards the Poles. In many respects, Poland features negatively in the German issue
               (and its negative image has been recently perpetuated — vide the results of Polish
               “tourism” to the FRG, GDR, and W<add type="edition">[est]</add> B<add type="edition"
                  >[erlin]</add> ).</p>
            <p>The fast-paced reunification process entails specific threats to Poland, e.g. the
               high number of Polish visits by GDR citizens in order to register their former
               properties (land, homes) with the intention of seeking damages for them. The voices
               in the FRG that advocated a compensation adjustment between Germany and Poland have
               not completely gone silent, either.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>Therefore, it could be concluded that the only right direction is to build
               pan-European structures based on the CSCE — with a US and Canadian presence in
               Europe. It would be appropriate to take advantage of Bonn’s declared aspirations to a
               European community before new structures of a reunified Germany ultimately
               consolidate.</p>
