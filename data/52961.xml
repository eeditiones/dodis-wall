               <dateline>East Berlin, 4 July 1990</dateline>
            </opener>
            <p n="1">If one could still think initially that a breather would be inserted after 1
               July to recover, it has now become clear that the GDR population sees no reason to
               prolong the continued existence of this state. The successful course of the
               introduction of the D-mark has brought more confidence in the future. Rarely is
               anything heard any more about the “insertion of own values/achievements” or about
               “proceeding on an equal footing together”. Protests about “selling out to the FRG”
               have fallen silent.</p>
            <p>In this mood it has become impossible to pursue non party politics and GDR parties,
               with the exception of the PDS, have become reconciled to their insignificance. Hence
               the ever-advancing dates on which they will “join” the FRG parties. Of course parties
               without an equivalent in the FRG naturally feel threatened as regards their continued
               existence. Meanwhile, the farmer’s party DBP, having emerged as a relative winner in
               the municipal elections of 6 May, has affiliated itself with the CDU. The original
               “Aufbruch” party DA of Minister Eppelmann<note xml:id="e6001">Rainer Eppelmann
                  (*1943), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57572">dodis.ch/P57572</ref>, Member of
                  the People’s Chamber of the GDR and Minister for National Defense
                  12.4.1990–3.10.1990.</note> is expected to follow this example soon. The DSU is
               unable to merge with the CSU for political reasons emanating from Bonn and Munich and
               will go under due to internal division, fueled by reproaches about the cooperation of
               its recent leadership with FRG representatives. Right-wing Germany is clearly
               gathering in the DSU, and because both DSU Ministers (Ebeling<note xml:id="e6007">Hans-Wilhelm Ebeling (*1934), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57573">dodis.ch/P57573</ref>, Minister for Economic Cooperation of the GDR
                  12.4.1990–3.10.1990.</note>/Development Cooperation and Diestel<note xml:id="e6013">Peter-Michael Diestel (*1952), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57574">dodis.ch/P57574</ref>, Interior Minister of
                  the GDR 12.4.1990–3.10.1990.</note>/Internal Affairs) have left their party
               without returning their portfolio, the DSU is no longer represented in the
               government.</p>
            <p>Today the Minister of Justice has also left his (liberal) party “because of excessive
               influence of West German FDP”. Read: because of too much criticism from the West
               German liberal side on the past of Minister Wünsche<note xml:id="e6021">Kurt Wünsche
                  (*1929), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57575">dodis.ch/P57575</ref>, Justice
                  Minister of the GDR 11.1.1990–16.8.1990.</note>. That Prime Minister De
                  Maiziere<note xml:id="e6027">Lothar de Maizière (*1940), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P54809">dodis.ch/P54809</ref>, GDR Prime Minister
                  12.4–2.10.1990.</note> keeps these three – now non-aligned – gentlemen indicates,
               in my opinion, that he has faith in Diestel and Wünsche as competent administrators
               who are to remain until December. Both in legislative adjustment and in dismantling
               the STASI, party-political fiddling is inconvenient. Nonetheless the term “government
               crisis” has already been used, but has not led to visible political excitement, a
               sign of waning interest in the ups and downs of the government that is already seen
               as an extension of Bonn.</p>
            <p>Of the 3 conditions for joint elections at the beginning of December that have been
               brought forward by the GDR coalition – the “Unification Treaty”<note xml:id="e6035">Quoted in German: <orig>Einigungsvertrag</orig>.</note>, the establishment of
               “Länder”, and the termination of the 2 + 4 consultations<note xml:id="e6038">Series
                  of meetings of the four Allied Powers (USA, Britain, France, USSR) and FRG plus
                  GDR.</note> – only the latter appears to constitute a potential problem. However,
               the GDR (population) has little to do with this: in this country the issue arouses
               hardly any interest and every result appears acceptable as long as it does not delay
               unification and, secondly, brings an end to foreign patronage. If the USSR continues
               to make trouble, this will certainly work against Moscow. The special GDR-USSR
               connection has long been chopped off mentally by the population. Which does not mean
               that “die Wirtschaft”<note xml:id="e6041">The economy, here West-German
                  entrepreneurship.</note> has lost its interest in the markets in the east. On the
               contrary, but almost exclusively as a sales market.</p>
