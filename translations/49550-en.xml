                  xml:id="e5291">Eckhard Bibow (*1930), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P54792"
                     >dodis.ch/P54792</ref>, GDR Ambassador in Bern 1986–1990.</note> contacts me
               with the following requests:</p>
            <p/>
            <p>1. He presents the <emph>joint declaration by all factions of the People’s
                  Parliament</emph> of 12.4.1990 (attachment<note xml:id="e5301">Joint declaration
                  by all factions of the People’s Parliament, 12 April 1990, <ref
                     target="https://dodis.ch/52352">dodis.ch/52352</ref>.</note>). The declaration,
               whose main points were made known by the media, constitutes, in B<add type="edition"
                  >[ibow]</add> ’s words, a general reckoning with the German people’s deplorable
               past, disowned by the GDR until now, as well as with more recent inglorious GDR
               activities. Official apologies are made to the Jewish people and Israel, to the
               Soviet Union, to the ČSSR (for the suppression of the Prague Spring), and the
               inviolability of the current Polish Western border is noted.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>2. B<add type="edition">[ibow]</add> furthermore emphasises the new government’s
               interest in <emph>bilateral rela</emph>tions with Switzerland. He enquires about a
               possible date for the visit, already agreed on in principle, of State Secretary
                  Jacobi<note xml:id="e5317">Klaus Jacobi (1929–2004), <ref
                     target="https://dodis.ch/P19511">dodis.ch/P19511</ref>, State Secretary of the
                  Swiss Federal Department of Foreign Affairs 1989–1992.</note> in Berlin. The
               signatory confirms this interest and suggests July 1990<note xml:id="e5323">The visit
                  took place on 11 October 1990.</note>.</p>
            <p>The ball is now in the GDR’s court, which intends to provide a specific suggestion
               for a date as soon as the identity of the host, the foreign ministry’s future No. 2,
               is known. According to B<add type="edition">[ibow]</add> , the current interim
               incumbent, Fleck, is most likely to be supplanted (Nier<note xml:id="e5331">Kurt Nier
                  (*1927), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P51057">dodis.ch/P51057</ref>, Deputy
                  Foreign Minister of the GDR 1973–1989.</note> has been retired a while ago) and
               replaced by a DSU politician (the CSU of the GDR). The new foreign minister, Social
               Democrat Meckel<note xml:id="e5337">Markus Meckel (*1952), <ref
                     target="https://dodis.ch/P54793">dodis.ch/P54793</ref>, Foreign Minister of the
                  GDR 12.4.–20.8.1990.</note>, has already stated that he will accept a DSU
               member.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>3. Finally, B<add type="edition">[ibow]</add> comes to the <emph>topic of
               visa</emph>. He says that at his embassy, the practical difficulties in coping with
               Swiss visa applications are growing. (A Swiss visa application has to be submitted
               through a travel agency and after 4 – 8 weeks and approval procedures by internal GDR
               authorities (according to B<add type="edition">[ibow]</add> for securing
               accommodation, amongst other things) reaches the local embassy to be issued.) He,
                  B<add type="edition">[ibow]</add> , can grant an immediate issuing of visa only in
               exceptional cases. I draw B<add type="edition">[ibow]</add> ’s attention to the
               discrepancy between terms (GDR 4 – 8 weeks, Swiss visa for GDR citizens no more than
               24 hours); B<add type="edition">[ibow]</add> has already broached this subject with
               Berlin and will now do so again, in order to gain leeway from his authorities for the
               immediate issuing of visas.</p>
            <p>Basically, B<add type="edition">[ibow]</add> and the signatory agree, however, that
               the problem can only be solved by suspending the visa requirement. B<add
                  type="edition">[ibow]</add> declares the GDR government’s willingness to
               temporarily abolish the requirement, with immediate effect, based on an informal,
               oral, and mutual declaration. After a trial period, the abolition can be
               contractually settled. This is how the GDR proceeded with Austria, for instance.</p>
