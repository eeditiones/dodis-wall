                        22.17.01/4-II.6/89</idno>. Written and signed by Thomas Nowotny,
                     dodis.ch/P57516; also published in Wilson Center, doc. 165711. This memo was
                     sent to all section leaders, the Cabinet of the Foreign Minister, all
                     departments of the Political Section as well as to all Austrian diplomatic
                     missions in states participating in the CSCE. On 20 September 1989, Ernst
                     Sucharipa attached a note to this file entitled <orig>German reunification? On
                        the ghost train ride of Department II.6</orig>. The statement should have
                     been forwarded to the Section Heads, the Cabinet of the Federal Minister, all
                     departments of the Political Section, the General Secretary, the Austrian
                     Embassies in Bonn, Berlin (East) and Moscow, the Austrian delegation in Berlin
                     as well as to all Austrian diplomatic representations in states participating
                     in the CSCE. However, for unknown reasons, it was not forwarded. The note read:
                        <orig>1) It is correct that there is again increasing talk everywhere about
                        the question of German reunification (or “new unification”, according to
                        IISS Director Heisbourg). Basic consideration of the issues raised in the
                        essay of department II.6 therefore seem inevitable in Austria. Here are the
                        first brief remarks from the perspective of the Eastern Europe Department;
                        2) In foreign policy, perception is often more important than reality:
                        Despite the circumstances mentioned by Department II.6., which “trivialize”
                        the dimension of a Germany consisting of the FRG and GDR, the impression
                        (the fear) will persist in Eastern (and also Western) Europe that such a
                        structure cannot be integrated into the European Peace Order. 3) Despite the
                        publicity-effective emigration movements from the GDR (Scale in 1989:
                        approx. 100,000 citizens, of which approx. 5/6 “legally”, 1/6 “illegally”)
                        there is a “GDR national consciousness” and pride in the benefits of its
                        “own”, “other” German state, which is not to be underestimated. The silent
                        majority is still a majority even in the GDR. The slowly forming opposition
                        groups want to keep their GDR (reformed and completely overhauled, but
                        distinct from the FRG). 4) In spite of Perestroika and Glasnost, the Soviet
                        Union looks everywhere to strictly maintain the territorial status quo.
                        German-political changes that go beyond, ‘change through rapprochement’ are
                        therefore not to be achieved without argument with Moscow.</orig>

               <dateline>Vienna, 19 September 1989</dateline>
            </opener>
            <p>A specter is haunting Europe. The specter of German reunification, and it scares the
               Western Europeans. This fear – rarely acknowledged – is behind many discussions about
               the future of European security.</p>
            <p>The two superpowers are apparently less bound by fear. One sometimes hears from both
               the US and the USSR that German “reunification” is not only possible, but perhaps
               even desirable. The expectations of the US and the USSR are, however, contradictory:
               The United States expects that a reunified Germany would push against the East, and
               weaken the USSR. The Soviet Union expects that a reunified Germany would step out of
               NATO, and thus fatally weaken NATO.</p>
            <p>This discussion of German reunification is surprising in some respects. After all,
               because of its treaties with the East, through its recognition of the GDR, and
               through its involvement in the CSCE process, the FRG seemed to have finally and
               irrevocably accepted the status quo in Europe and thus the existence of two</p>
            <p> German states, and without ulterior motives. Against the backdrop of these hard
               facts, the question begs to be asked: How serious is this new flare-up talk of
               reunification? Is there really nothing more to it than a mere superficial and purely
               verbal response to the advance of the right-wing nationalist “Republicans” in the
               FRG? Or is it to be taken more seriously?</p>
            <p> The question was broached at the Ambassadors’ Conference in early September. The
               ambassadors in both Berlin<note xml:id="e210">Franz Wunderbaldinger (*1927), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P52001">dodis.ch/P52001</ref>, Austrian Ambassador in
                  West Berlin 1985–1990.</note> and Bonn<note xml:id="e216">Friedrich Bauer (*1930),
                     <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P51060">dodis.ch/P51060</ref>, Austrian
                  Ambassador in Bonn 1986–1990.</note> were unanimously convinced that this talk is
               not to be taken seriously. Nobody in a position of political responsibility,
               according to the Austrian ambassador in Bonn, would really aim for a “reunification”
               with the GDR.<note xml:id="e222">During the ambassadors’ conference at the Austrian
                  Foreign Ministry on 8 September 1989 Wunderbaldinger noted: <orig>German-German
                     relationship: contractual regulations in many areas, strong contacts at various
                     low levels. Large flow of visitors in both directions. Bauer later added: The
                     West was not prepared for the so strongly desired reform process in the East,
                     and has no concept. The FRG sees the EC as a place to embed itself in Western
                     Europe (leading it out of the status of a defeated country). Bonn wants to
                     include the EC in its own policy on Germany. Relationship FRG-GDR: little
                     information about intra-German trade. Meeting of Bonn-Berlin representatives
                     about adapting intra-German to internal market rules. FRG seeks osmotic
                     relationship with GDR. Reunification in the Bismarkian sense is not
                     sought.</orig> The head of the political section of the Austrian foreign
                  ministry ambassador Erich Maximilian Schmid summarized: <orig>The transformation
                     process in the East was desired by the West, yet it was completely unprepared
                     for this. The reduction of tensions resulted from the economic impossibility of
                     a permanent arms race. This should have been predictable. Processes in the East
                     are to be assessed positively, but there is a danger of it spiraling out of
                     control and resulting in destabilization. Austria welcomes upheavals in the
                     East, but these pose a danger that Austria could be associated with a kind of
                     gray zone in Central Europe. German reunification: a theoretical discussion
                     topic indeed, but not currently a reality.</orig> Cf. the minutes of the
                  Ambassadors’ Conference, 1989; <idno>Working group East-West, Envoy Johann
                     Plattner, Vienna, 8 September 1989, ÖStA, AdR, BMAA, II-Pol 1989, GZ.
                     502.00.00/13-II.1/89.</idno>
                    </note> The coexistence of the two states would be
               accepted by virtually all. The maximum goal supported by almost all political parties
               would merely be a “Germany policy” that intensifies existing contacts between both
               States at all levels.</p>
            <p>The Austrian Ambassador in Berlin claimed there was no great pressure for radical
               changes in the GDR. Sudden outbursts and changes of course are not to be expected.
               Because it works on the whole, the state would also be accepted by the
               population.</p>
            <p>The opinions expressed by the two ambassadors describe – probably accurately – the
               current state, which is not a given. They assume that this state will essentially
               remain unchanged. This may be correct, but need not be so. There is some evidence
               that attitudes toward “reunification” are changing in the two German states. In the
               two German states, there are signs of a fundamental change in the political climate.
               In the FRG, for example, the Historians’ Dispute (in which German war-guilt was
               relativized) changed the emotional-political framework in which postwar international
               relations were anchored. Three to four years ago it would have been unthinkable that
               the Polish-German border would be called into question again by a high-ranking
               politician and many years after its recognition by the Warsaw Treaty.</p>
            <p>Three or four years ago this would have signified the end of every political career.
               Not so today. A whole new attitude towards the European East has established itself–
               obviously and gradually there is a renewed belief in a special “German mission in the
               East.” This mission goes far beyond the “Ostpolitik” of Willy Brandt<note xml:id="e231">Willy Brandt (1913–1992), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P15409">dodis.ch/P15409</ref>, Foreign Minister of the FRG 1966–1969 and Chancellor of
                  the FRG 1969–1974.</note>. Its essential goal had only been the acceptance of the
               status quo. But the objectives of today’s German Ostpolitik are more ambitious. In
               their new nationalism, the aggressive advocacy of unification, and their skepticism
               towards the west and European integration the right-wing “Republicans” are thus a
               symptom of a political change in mood that encompasses more than just their
               voters.</p>
            <p>The GDR appears to be the most solid of the communist states – especially in economic
               terms. Nevertheless, this country has political feet of clay. The binding power of
               communist ideology has – if it ever was great – anyhow disappeared. This also
               happened in other communist countries. These other states, however, base their social
               cohesion and identity on something other than communist ideology – on religion or –
               mostly – on nationalism. There is probably no such thing as GDR nationalism. At best,
               there is a certain feeling of connection with their homeland. One probably got used
               to some convenient facilities of “real existing socialism” in the GDR – such as
               secure jobs, cheap food staples and apartments, etc. But that alone does not secure
               identity, and this comfort will gradually wane in the course of necessary economic
               reforms, which will come sooner or later, even in the GDR. Likewise, it is becoming
               increasingly difficult to hold the state together with dictatorial measures. Where,
               if not mainly to the FRG, would the GDR turn if its economic and political opening
               can no longer be delayed?</p>
            <p>Reunification may, therefore, very well be on the future political agenda of the two
               German states. Formally, the other – and especially Western European – states cannot
               object. The principle of self-determination is recognized internationally. This
               principle will not be questioned openly by any Western European country and not when
               applied to the two German states. Actually, no one wants a real application of this
               principle by a “reunification.” This fear, however, is not articulated openly. One is
               only too aware of the fact that taking an open stand against reunification would only
               strengthen the extreme and nationalist forces in the Federal Republic. Hence, there
               is no open political dialogue with the FRG on this issue – only unadmitted silent
               fear.</p>
            <p>If, in what form, and when there is a merger of the German states, is certainly
               uncertain. In any case, the desire for “reunification” in both German states cannot
               be ruled out, especially in the FRG, once it ceases to be a merely abstract and
               distant goal and becomes a specific concern. One should thus take the possibility of
               a reunification seriously and really examine what the consequences would be. Would
               such a reunification actually blow up the entire postwar order?</p>
            <p>Reunification would certainly be a huge shock for this order. It is argued below that
               the European postwar order would not have to fall apart because of this. Even a
               reunified Germany would not be so strong that it would dominate the European
               continent economically and militarily. It would just be a very big country among the
               other major European states.</p>

            <p>The surface of a reunified Germany would be 357,000 km<hi>2</hi>, far less than the
               combined area of Poland and Czechoslovakia (439,000 km<hi>2</hi>).</p>
            <p>In the GDR, the population is growing slowly, in West Germany it is dropping sharply.
               In 2025, a “unified Germany” would have a population of 74.5 million. France would,
               in contrast, have a population of 63.7 million, and Czechoslovakia and Poland
               together would have a combined population of 66.5 million.</p>
            <p>Not only is the FRG’s population growth low (or even negative), the FRG’s economy is
               also far less dynamic than itself and other European countries assume. The most
               reliable measure of the development of economic power is the development of
               productivity. The development of productivity in the Federal Republic of Germany has
               been slow since 1960 and risen far less than in either France or Italy.</p>
            <p>These trends are likely to continue, and in 10 years at the latest France will have
               caught up in absolute economic power with the FRG.</p>
            <p>One must assume that even with reunification the current GDR could not immediately be
               brought up to the economic level of the FRG. One could therefore assume that the
               productivity of the area that is the GDR today, even in 2025, would be somewhere –
               perhaps around 15% – below the productivity of the current FRG. The entire economic
               potential of the two unified areas would therefore in 2025 approximately match the
               economic power that France will then have.</p>
            <p>The economic power of a “unified Germany” must not just be compared with France, but
               also with the rest of the Western European states. Above all, the southern EC
               countries (such as Italy and Spain) will – as in the past, but also in the future –
               develop more rapidly economically, so the economic and political weight of these EC
               countries will increase when compared to the FRG or a “reunified Germany”.</p>
            <p>A reunified Germany would not be significantly greater in population and economic
               strength than the FRG is today: namely, one among the most powerful nations of
               Europe.</p>
            <p>The consequences of a “reunification” cannot, however, only be looked at from a
               purely economic standpoint: they also need to be viewed from a military security
               perspective. What would be the consequences of “reunification” in this area?</p>

            <p>“Reunification” is sometimes associated with a “neutralization” of the then united
               Germany. Neutralization would thus be condition or result of an association of the
               two German states.</p>

                    <emph>First</emph>, as Khrushchev<note xml:id="e287">Nikita Khrushchev (1894–1971),

                  the Communist Party of the Soviet Union 1953–1964 and Chairman of the Council of
                  Ministers of the Soviet Union 1958–1964.</note> said during his tenure to the then
               Foreign Minister Kreisky:<note xml:id="e293">Bruno Kreisky (1911–1990), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P2507">dodis.ch/P2507</ref>, Austrian Foreign Minister
                  1959–1966 and Federal Chancellor 1970–1983.</note> “Neutrality is a status which
               is appropriate for a small country located geographically and security-politics-wise
               between two powers.” Neutrality does not apply to a state that, because of its own
               great influence, whether it wants that or not, becomes a significant factor in
               international relations. The Ostpolitik of a reunified Germany, even if that state is
               formally “neutral”, in practice would not be neutral. Whatever a large state
               undertakes has far-reaching consequences, both in the West and in the East of the
               continent. For example, whether a small neutral country participates in sanctions
               does not significantly increase or reduce the effectiveness of such sanctions, but
               whether a country with more than 70 million inhabitants participates, this determines
               very well whether such sanctions are effective or not.</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Second</emph>, a “neutralization” of the current FRG (as proposed by the
               neoconservative American intellectual Irving Kristol<note xml:id="e301">Irving
                  Kristol (1920–2009), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57517">dodis.ch/P57517</ref>,
                  American author and social scientist, protagonist of the neoconservative
                  movement.</note> in the enclosed article) would weaken the Western defense
               alliance so much as to make it insubstantial. “Geopolitically”, geography simply
               privileges a large landmass to the east of the continent. In contrast, NATO-allied
               Western Europe has less strategic depth. If this depth were further reduced by the
               “neutralization” of the FRG, a military counterweight to the Soviet Union could in no
               way be maintained on such shrunken territory. A “balance” (or better: a
               conflict-hindering balance of power) would no longer exist.</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Third</emph>, the neutralization of West Germany would naturally bring about
               the withdrawal of US troops from Europe (which are stationed for the most part in the
               FRG). Europeans doubt – probably rightly – the ultimate effectiveness of the “nuclear
               guarantee” granted to them by the US. More important is the guarantee – or “hostage”
               function of American troops. These troops enable – more effectively than nuclear
               missiles – the “coupling” of the European theater of war to the United States. This
               coupling would be lost with the withdrawal of US troops.</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Fourth</emph>, there is perhaps a problem with a reunited Germany arming itself
               with nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons are today quite “cheap” to produce. The
               technical know-how is certainly available in the FRG. The incentive to guarantee
               one’s security in such a “cheap” way through nuclear deterrence is therefore
               considerable. Speaking against the purchase of national nuclear weapons is certainly
               the uncertainty that the possession of such weapons would trigger in European
               countries in East and West. Speaking for the possession of nuclear weapons is the
               fact that a reunified and neutral Germany would be surrounded by potential enemies,
               who could be held at bay best and most “cheaply” with the aid of nuclear
               deterrence.</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Fifth</emph>, one must question if the FRG stepping out of the western defense
               alliance would even be physically possible as things stand. The FRG is nowadays very
               tightly integrated economically and socially with the rest of Western Europe. This
               Western European integration and cooperation will increasingly extend to security
               matters. The situation where European security is provided largely by the United
               States can historically not be maintained indefinitely. Western Europe will
               increasingly have to provide for its own security – sooner rather than later.</p>
            <p>Security policy is all-embracing. It also has a specifically economic aspect and an
               economic basis. If a “neutralized” reunified Germany were to pursue an independent
               security policy, then the FRG would have to, at least in some important areas (such
               as in technology), free itself from already existing dependencies and connections
               with Western European countries. But the integration of Western Europe has already
               progressed too far. This option of stepping out of Western European cooperation is no
               longer open to the FRG. For example, the FRG no longer has the option to develop its
               own aviation and aerospace industry separately from the rest of Western Europe.</p>
            <p>It is of course the – acknowledged or unacknowledged – objective of the remaining
               Western European countries to strengthen the integration of the FRG into Western
               Europe and make it irreversible. Behind the integration-friendly policy of France is
               not just France’s desire to secure its influence through a united Western Europe,
               which it could not exercise acting alone in today’s world. With this policy, France
               is also pursuing its objective of strengthening the “Western tying” of the FRG to an
               extent that makes it inextricable.</p>
            <p>Hence, it is both unlikely and undesirable that the FRG should withdraw from NATO to
               become neutral simply in order to “unite” with the GDR. This would also not be in the
               long-term interests of the Warsaw Pact and the USSR. A united Western Europe (also
               including the FRG) would certainly have a far less ambitious “Ostpolitik” than a
               reunified, neutral Germany.</p>
            <p>What would be the consequences of the more likely solution in which the reunified
               Germany does not become “neutral” and the FRG remains in the Western defense
               alliance? This would certainly result in a military shift at the expense of the East.
               But this shift is less far-reaching than one would at first assume.</p>
            <p>The advantage that the Warsaw Pact currently draws from the fact that the GDR is a
               member shows itself in the light of the present – still – ruling Soviet military
               doctrine. This demands that in the event of an East-West war, Warsaw Pact troops will
               advance to the Atlantic Ocean as quickly as possible in order to prevent the arrival
               of reinforcements from the US. The “Spur” in the south of the GDR that protrudes into
               West Germany (“Fulda Gap”) would serve as a springboard for such an offensive.</p>
            <p>
                    <figure>
                  <graphic url="https://www.dodis.ch/res/img/qdd12-img2.jpg"/>

               </figure>
                </p>
            <p>However, it is intended and also probable that the military doctrines will be
               changed. The predominant doctrines in both the West (“deep strike,” FOFA) and the
               East (“forward defense”) assume “attack is the best defense”. These offensive
               military tactics are contrary to the principally defensive strategic objectives of
               the two alliances, who just want to maintain the status quo and seek no territorial
               gains.</p>
            <p>If the military alliances and, especially, the Warsaw Pact convert their “defense” to
               a purely defensive one, with no element of attack against Western Europe, this
               removes the goal of reaching the Atlantic coast as quickly as possible, thus lowering
               the military value of the East German spur protruding into the FRG. This reduces the
               military disadvantage of withdrawing the GDR from the Warsaw Pact. The loss of
               militarily useable terrain is hardly decisive strategically. The GDR is, in its
               east-west dimensions of 200–300 km, a relatively narrow state. In contrast, the new
               East-West border, also being the eastern border of a reunified Germany, would have
               the advantage of being straighter than the previous military East-West border and
               therefore easier to defend.</p>
            <p>Indeed, Czechoslovakia would be more negatively affected by such a shift in the
               military dividing line to the east. Its north-west border is currently covered
               against NATO by the GDR. If the GDR withdraws from the Warsaw Pact, this border would
               be directly exposed to NATO. A solution to this problem could be to “demilitarize”
               the territory of the present GDR even after reunification with the FRG, although the
               reunified Germany would belong to NATO, and this demilitarization could be secured
               through international guarantees.</p>

            <p>
                    <emph>Summary</emph>:</p>
            <p>Despite lip service supporting the right of “self-determination”, at present no
               European country desires German “reunification”. The fear of such a reunification
               can, however, become a highly destabilizing element for European policy, even without
               being able to prevent reunification. Whether reunification actually happens is, of
               course, uncertain, but it cannot be excluded. In both German states there are
               developments that make such a reunification more probable today than it was just two
               to three years ago. A reunified Germany could and should not be neutral or
               neutralized. If at least the western part of the reunified Germany remains integrated
               in NATO, and the entire Germany is a member of the EC, then no threat would arise
               through a newly formed military and economically dominant superstate, which is the
               general fear.</p>
