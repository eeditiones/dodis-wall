                  Schabowski<note xml:id="e1489">Günter Schabowski (1929–2015), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P56902">dodis.ch/P56902</ref>, member of the SED

               the Central Committee on the 9<hi>th</hi> on the question when the arrangement for
               travel to the Federal Republic and West Berlin that he had just made public would
               enter into force. A directive that he presumed was already known to the assembled
               press, but which he himself clearly did not know intimately. The border guards were
               also unprepared, but confronted by the inflowing masses they threw open the gates at
               the Borholmer Strasse crossing, stepped back and let the flow of people pass by.
               Shortly afterwards the other border crossings followed including Checkpoint Charlie.
               The Wall had – in the words of governing mayor Momper<note xml:id="e1498">Walter

                  Governing Mayor of West Berlin 16.2.1989–24.1.1991.</note> – lost its relevance.
               On 9 November 1989, this inhuman and monstrous edifice that was founded on 13 August
               1961 fell. The cornered leadership of the collapsing “First State of Workers and
               Farmers on German Soil”<note xml:id="e1504">Quoted in German: <orig>Erster Arbeiter
                     und Bauernstaat auf deutschem Boden.</orig>
                    </note> had risked the desperate
               flight forward to stem the bloodletting of “Republikflucht”<note xml:id="e1509">
                        <orig>Republikflucht</orig>: the act of fleeing from the GDR (culpable under

            <p>In Berlin (West) this “Day of Re-Encounter”<note xml:id="e1514">Quoted in German:
                     <orig>Tag des Wiedersehens.</orig>
                    </note> (Momper) led to an emotionally
               charged cheerfully chaotic exuberant weekend in which nearly two million people from
               the Eastern Sector and all parts of the GDR flowed into the city. Many with tears in
               their eyes, hand in hand, elderly, young people, families with children, toddlers and
               babies (one was even born here), they came in their small two-stroke cars or on foot
               in a ceaseless flow of people. Some came to reunite with relatives, others for a
               specific purpose “having my car repaired and taking a beer” – as one of them told me
               – to shop, but most of them came to establish in person that the incredible had
               become true and see the forbidden land. Only a few, about 5000, mostly immediate
               family members of previous refugees, decided to stay. This incredible coming and
               going led to enormous traffic chaos both in the East at the few border crossings,
               where most left their cars to cross on foot, and in the West, where the public
               transport system could barely handle the flow, despite deploying all available
               resources. The GDR quickly opened new crossings, one of them located on the
               historically significant Potsdammer Platz in the middle of the “Todesstreifen”<note xml:id="e1519">
                        <orig>Todesstreifen</orig>: the Death Perimeter (on the Eastern
                  side of the Wall).</note> on the 12<hi>th</hi>. In about three hours’ time, some
               15,000 flower bouquets from the Netherlands were handed out to welcome those from the
               East at the initiative of the flower trade fair Aalsmeer. It was a gesture witnessed
               by Federal President Weizsäcker<note xml:id="e1525">Richard von Weizsäcker
                  (1920–2015), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P5944">dodis.ch/P5944</ref>, President
                  of the FRG 1.7.1984 –30.6.1994.</note> and governing mayor Momper.</p>
            <p>The western part of the city responded openly, warmly and enthusiastically. The first
               people to arrive were showered with champagne and many were welcomed as guests in the
               house. Special arrangements for the quick payment of the so-called “Begrüssungsgeld”
               (DM 100 per year per person), special offers of coveted goods in stores (sometimes
               acceptance of parity between the DM and GDR currency), free concerts and
               performances, etc. etc. The event, however, focused on the Kurfürstendamm, where
               visitors flocked to witness the big unknown of capitalist consumption economics with
               their own eyes. Here a true people’s party of fraternization developed. Striking was
               the festive but very disciplined and controlled atmosphere.</p>
            <p>Below are some points of special significance:</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>a. Reunification</emph>
            </p>
            <p>A false note was introduced into the festivities by the politicians, namely the CDU
               and Federal Chancellor Kohl<note xml:id="e1541">Helmut Kohl (1930–2017), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P31852">dodis.ch/P31852</ref>, Chancellor of the FRG

               This was expressed on the one hand in a sharp disagreement at the Special Session of
               the Berlin House of Deputies on 10 November in the presence of the Federal Chancellor

               unity of Europe, in which the German people are also free to determine their

            <p>It was painful that the Chancellor was afterwards whistled at by many of the
               thousands who were present, but a significant indication of the prevailing mood was
               that in his speech he later reproached ruling mayor Momper as having spoken of “the
               people of the GDR”, which led to a sharp exchange of words.</p>

                  West Berlin, 1984–16.3.1989.</note>, who also called for the GDR to break down the
               Wall and open the Brandenburg Gate was a false note.</p>
            <p>The visitors and the West Berlin population, did not appear to support this theme.
               For them it was a meeting, an association and a rediscovery. The rest could wait.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>b. Brandenburg Gate</emph>
            </p>
            <p>The only incident of significance occurred on this historic spot. A clear separation
               here is symbolic for both the political and international legal identity of the GDR.
               The GDR decision is limited to the broadening of the travel options for its own
               citizens to the Federal Republic and Berlin (West) and possibly other states. The
               national border of the independent nation of the GDR will therefore remain
               unaffected. Attempts by Berlin’s youths to pull down segments of the Wall and occupy
               the outer Wall at the Brandenburg Gate in the evening hours of 10 November were, from
               this perspective, border crossings. The GDR responded very cautiously and in a
               controlled manner. The water cannon gave the young people wet suits but was effective
               and afterwards posting a detachment of unarmed border troops on the Wall
               sufficed.</p>
            <p>An agreement with the West Berlin police that included a promise that it would
               counter further disturbances made even this redundant.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>c. Cooperation</emph>
            </p>
            <p>The situation that arose as a result of the GDR decree forced the government and
               public services of both districts to contact and cooperation that was unheard of and
               which ran counter to many existing regulations. Most characteristic was the joint
               inauguration of the Potsdamer Platz crossing by reigning mayor Momper and
               Oberbürgermeister Krack<note xml:id="e1595">Erhard Krack (1931–2000), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P55386">dodis.ch/P55386</ref>, Mayor of East Berlin
                  11.2.1974–15.2.1990.</note> on the morning of 12 November. In their official
               capacities, they had never previously had any contact with each other. Afterwards,
               Federal President von Weizsäcker had a conversation with GDR border troops on GDR
               territory.</p>
            <p>The nature of the discussion was pragmatic, the goal an undisturbed and smooth flow
               of visitor traffic. From the GDR side, breaches were made, stations opened and the
               West Berlin police, fire brigade and public transport took care of the removal of
               watchtowers, traffic safety and lines and public transport from the new crossings
               (sometimes even on GDR territory where for example a West Berlin bus service was
               extended to Potsdam). An emergency telephone connection between the two police
               headquarters and contact at the highest level has now become a fact while on the work
               floor at the crossings the GDR border soldier and the West Berlin policeman stand
               side by side, beaming enthusiastically.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>d. The Future</emph>
            </p>
            <p>The euphoria will soon fade and then the question will arise how to proceed. From the
               GDR side the assurance has now been given that all this will not be reversed or
               adjusted in a limiting sense of the word. However, things, in particular the
               “non-bureaucratic” conduct of affairs, will have to be replaced by a more regular
               settlement. This means a continuous flow of visitors who will come to do their
               shopping here and maybe find employment.</p>
            <p>More serious is the danger of illegal exports of scarce GDR consumer goods for
               illegal trade in Berlin (West). Since a cross-country skiing boot is available over
               there for 49 GDR mark and the unofficial exchange rate is 1 DM for 10 GDR marks
               (official parity) this will speak for itself. The ominous word monetary reform, to
               prevent the “Clearance sale of the GDR”<note xml:id="e1611">Quoted in German:
                     <orig>Ausverkauf der DDR.</orig>
                    </note> has already been used over there and
               seems to be a compelling first step towards economic sanitation. Meanwhile interim
               arrangements and agreements will be required. Here too, intensive cooperation between
               Senate and GDR authorities will be necessary.</p>
            <p>Given that it is not to be expected that the GDR state and (party) leadership will
               accept that the Soviets will resume their formal role as occupying forces, and in
               fact the Soviet Union will certainly not be willing to do so, the Allies are now
               facing a more difficult reconsideration. In some respects they have been passed on
               the left hand side by developments and can do little else than accept that they too
               are spectators at events in which they play no role. The situation at Check Point
               Charlie during the weekend was significant. Between the crowd of West Berliners who
               rejoiced in welcoming their East German countrymen and fellow city inhabitants, an
               American, a French and a British military policeman appeared lost in observing the
               formalities of painstakingly checking returning compatriots (military or civil).</p>
