            <p n="1">For the first time in 42 years, the mayors of East Berlin and West Berlin held
               a joint meeting in the “Rote Rathaus (Red Municipal Building)” on Tuesday, 12
               June.</p>
            <p>East Berlin Mayor Tino Schwierzina<note xml:id="e5797">Tino Schwierzina (1927–2003),

                  Berlin 30.5.1990–11.1.1991.</note> (SPD) and West Berlin Mayor Walter Momper<note

                  16.2.1989–24.1.1991.</note> (SPD) have underlined the historical nature of the
               meeting and stated that they decided to meet in the same building every
               fortnight.</p>
            <p>The demolition of the Berlin Wall and holding the Olympic Games in Berlin in the year
               2000 were the main topics discussed at the meetings between the two mayors.</p>
            <p>In fact, the demolition of the Berlin Wall has begun as of today (13 June). Momper
               announced that border controls between Berlin’s two sides will be eliminated as of 1
               July 1990. The mayors declared that the unification of Berlin will be completed
               following the election of the joint city council and emphasized that the unified
               Berlin should be the capital of the new and united Germany.</p>
            <p>As you may recall, after World War II, Berlin City Council convened for the first
               time on 21 May 1945 and elected engineer Dr Arthur Werner<note xml:id="e5815">Arthur
                  Werner (1877–1967), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57537">dodis.ch/P57537</ref>,
                  Mayor of Berlin 17.5.1945–5.12.1946.</note>, aged 70, as mayor.</p>
            <p>Three years later, the joint city council was included in the British Occupation
               Region. Upon this, a separate municipality was established in East Berlin, which was
               under the occupation of the USSR, and Friedrich Ebert<note xml:id="e5823">Friedrich

               first mayor on 30 November 1948.</p>
