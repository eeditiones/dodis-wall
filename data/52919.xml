            <p>Dear Christopher,</p>
            <p>1. The minor squall that blew up following David Gow’s <emph>Guardian</emph> article
               of 7 September<note xml:id="e6758">David Gow (*1945), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57471">dodis.ch/P57471</ref>, Correspondent of The
                  Guardian in Bonn 1989–1995. The headline read: <orig>Bonn getting too close to
                     Moscow</orig>.</note> and German press comment after the treaty signing on 12
               September prompts me to put on record a few impressions of the last forty-eight hours
               before signature of this historic treaty.</p>
            <p>2. After four consecutive days work in East Berlin from 4 to 7 September the
               Political Directors parted late on the Friday with an agreement on an enumerated ten
               article draft treaty subject to a couple of square bracketed passages and accompanied
               by a Soviet proposal, which had no status, for a further draft article on “crossing
               the line”. We had agreed to foregather in Moscow in the early evening of 11 September
               to vet the final technical cosmetics by legal advisers and treaty experts, leaving it
               to Ministers to resolve on the morning of 12 September the three main outstanding
               issues (dual capable systems, crossing the line, suspension of QRRs<note xml:id="e6766">Quadripartite Rights and Responsibilities.</note>). Signature was
               then scheduled to take place at 4 pm the same day. This put the Russians under a
               pleasing time bind.</p>
            <p>3. Less than twenty-four hours after we left Berlin, when Bondarenko<note xml:id="e6771">Aleksander Bondarenko (1922–2010), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57463">dodis.ch/P57463</ref>, Head of the Third

               from the Far East, we heard in our respective capitals that the Russians were
               proposing instead a further full day of Political Director work in Moscow on 11
               September (requiring us to travel to Moscow on 10 September). This transparent
               attempt to give themselves more room for manoeuvre should in my view have been
               resisted. But by the time I got Kastrup<note xml:id="e6789">Dieter Kastrup (*1937),
                     <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57383">dodis.ch/P57383</ref>, Political Director

               September, he had already conceded the point. The Americans being already in Moscow
               after the Helsinki Summit, we and the French were clearly not in a position to hold
                  out.<note xml:id="e6795">The Helsinki Summit, to discuss the Iraq-Kuwait war, was
                  held between Presidents Bush and Gorbachev on 5 September 1990.</note>
                </p>
            <p>4. We duly met in the whited sepulchre of the Octyabrskaya Hotel on the morning of 11
               September. A hastily arranged One plus Three for a few minutes beforehand
               revealed:</p>
            <p>a) intense German annoyance about David Gow in the Guardian of 7 September, over
               which they suspected the UK; and,</p>
            <p>b) that the FRG delegation had already been holding bilaterals with the Russians in
               an attempt to sew up a deal on the final points, misrepresenting US views (at least
               to us) into the bargain.</p>
            <p>The Russians for their part had advanced the signature ceremony from 4 p.m. to 12.30
               p.m. the next day and confirmed that Gorbachev<note xml:id="e6805">Mikhail Gorbachev

                  of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union 25.5.1989–15.3.1990 and President of the
                  Soviet Union 15.3.1990–25.12.1991.</note> would attend personally. [Kastrup then
               also told me that he thought the Russians would return to their earlier attempt to
               get us to drop the words “upon German request” from the provision in Article 5
               covering the continued troop presence of the three Allies in Berlin, in an attempt
               further to blur the distinction between the Allied presence and the residual Soviet
               forces presence. I told Kastrup, having taken the precaution of speaking to Charles
                  Powell<note xml:id="e6811">Charles Powell (*1941), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57468">dodis.ch/P57468</ref>, Private Secretary to
                  the British Prime Minister, 1983–1991.</note> over the weekend before leaving
               London (the Secretary of State<note xml:id="e6817">Douglas Hurd (*1930), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57401">dodis.ch/P57401</ref>, British Secretary of

               Japan), that I knew the Prime Minister’s Office attached importance to retaining
               those words. This may be partly the origin of the later German press canard that
               British firmness stemmed from the views of the Prime Minister. I had not however
               discussed “crossing the line” with Charles Powell, because I did not want to risk
               placing myself under unrealistic restrictions on that issue. In the event the
               Russians did not return to the charge on the words “upon German request”.]<note xml:id="e6823">Square brackets in original.</note>
                </p>
            <p>5. When we broke at 4 pm on 11 September the position was as described in Moscow Tel
               No. 1694<note xml:id="e6827">This telegram reported that all remaining issues had
                  been settled except <orig>crossing the line</orig>, which looked precarious
                  because of <orig>German weakness and apparent American
               acquiescence</orig>.</note>. Dual capable systems were already safely in the bag.
               Suspension of QRR did not look a stopper. The real crux was on “crossing the line”.
               The pass had already been virtually sold for the transitional period covering Soviet
               troop withdrawal, on the basis that paragraph 1 of Article 5 would preclude any
               military activity there by armed forces of states other than the Soviet Union and
               Germany. It also looked uncertain whether for the period thereafter we could hold the
               position with a provision excluding merely large-scale military manoeuvres (as
               defined by the 1986 Stockholm CSBMs Agreement), which up to then had been
               Kvitsinsky’s professed major preoccupation. Kastrup was arguing for a simple
               provision against all deployment, coupled with some kind of oral statement; on the
               grounds that such was the sense of Stavropol: the reference (ill-defined) to
               manoeuvres appeared to be intended as a compromise. Dufourcq<note xml:id="e6830">Bertrand Dufourcq (*1933), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57455">dodis.ch/P57455</ref>, Political Director, French Ministry of Foreign Affairs,

               his Minister was not due to arrive in Moscow until 3.30 a.m. on 12 September.
                  Zoellick’s<note xml:id="e6836">Robert Zoellick (*1953), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57469">dodis.ch/P57469</ref>, Counsellor, US

               uncertainly.</p>
            <p>6. With the Secretary of State’s arrival around 5.30 p.m., bilateral Ministerials got
               under way—Baker<note xml:id="e6844">James Baker (*1930), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P56605">dodis.ch/P56605</ref>, United States Secretary

                  Vice-Chancellor and Minister for Foreign Affairs of the FRG
                  1.10.1982–17.5.1992.</note> Secretary of State/Baker and later Secretary of
               State/Genscher. The upshot was that we and the Americans (joined by the French)
               agreed to camp for the rest of the evening on Ministerial instructions to the effect
               that, if paragraph 1 of Article 5 precluded all military activity [during the
               transitional period, paragraph 3 of Article 5 should go no further than precluding
               deployment “with the aim of holding large scale military manoeuvres”. But our
               scheduled resumption at 8 pm that evening was delayed for a further hour by private
               German/Russian bilateral activity elsewhere – a performance described as “tacky” by
               Zoellick, who was greatly irritated by it.</p>
            <p>7. When Kastrup and Kvitsinsky eventually returned after 9 p.m., the former put to us
               in the margin before resumption his provisional agreement with the Russians on a
               simple “no deployment” formula coupled with a four point oral statement by Genscher
               at the Plenary negotiating session, which the Russians would undertake to listen to
               in silence. [The Genscher four points were: no large scale military manoeuvres;
               military activities below that threshold were not specifically excluded but would not
               necessarily take place, the application of the word “deployment” would be for
               sovereign Germany to decide; in doing so, she would exercise reason and
               responsibility and bear in mind the security interests of all.]<note xml:id="e6858">Square brackets in original.</note>
                </p>
            <p>8. This triggered sharp open disagreement among the One plus Three on the sidelines
               of the meeting. The thrust of UK/US/French objections was that the Alliance should
               not bind itself by treaty with the Soviet Union in a way which would indefinitely
               foreclose options extending far beyond the foreseeable circumstances and would
               further limit German sovereignty beyond Stavropol. With 12 billion DM in their kitty
               and the world expecting signature in little more than twelve hours, we did not need
               to offer the Russians any more concessions. The German response was that this was all
               totally unrealistic since peace had broken out in Europe. (“Oh come on! You can’t be
               serious.” was the stock rejoinder.) They also argued that the German word “verlegt”
               describing the deal at Stavropol went a good way beyond a mere no stationing
               agreement. When the formal session resumed I asked Kvitsinsky whether he would
               confirm that silence by Shevardnadze in the face of an oral statement by Genscher
               could be interpreted at the very least as the Soviet Union not disagreeing with this
               statement. Kvitsinsky declined to provide any such assurance.</p>
            <p>9. After further skirmishing we broke inconclusively around 10.30 pm. At that point
               there were at least five alternatives in the air.</p>
            <p>i) Soviet position: no military activity in transitional period, simple “no
               deployment” formula thereafter;</p>
            <p>ii) US/UK/French proposal: no military activity for transitional period and “no
               deployment with the aim of holding large-scale military manoeuvres” thereafter;</p>
            <p>iii) FRG position: as for the Russians, but with oral statement by Genscher at
               plenary session on 12 September to which Shevardnadze would make no reply.</p>
            <p>iv) Zoellick fallback mark I: instead of formulation at (ii) above, after “no
               deployment” add new sentence in treaty (crafted with the UK) as follows: “Decisions
               on whether, and if so what kind of, military activities take place in that part of
               Germany would be for the sovereign united Germany to make in accordance with
               provisions of this treaty, the principles reflected in the Preamble and taking
               account of the security interests of the states party.”</p>
            <p>v) Zoellick fallback mark II: simple “no deployment” formula in the Treaty plus a
               letter from Genscher either to the Three Allied Foreign Ministers or to the NATO
               Secretary-General setting out the Genscher Four Points.</p>
            <p>10. At this juncture the Russians decided to put the frighteners on a bit. They sent
               senior MFA<note xml:id="e6876">Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</note> officials round to
               each delegation (in my case catching me in my bedroom just short of midnight) to
               state formally on instructions that because of the failure to agree at official
               level, the plenary session at 10 am the next day at the Octyabrskaya had been
               postponed, the timing of signature was in question and the press would have to be
               informed. Instead Mr Shevardnadze wished to see his Ministerial colleagues alone at a
               working session in the MFA Mansion at Alexander Tolstoy Street next morning at the
               same hour. This tactic, which in my view was never convincing since the Russians were
               under the greatest time pressure of all, got Genscher in enough of a lather for him
               to go off to see Baker at 1.15 in the morning, when the latter had already taken his
               sleeping pill and final bedtime drink. [With hindsight this gives a subtle extra
               flavour to the reference in Baker’s speeches at the plenary session and the press
               conference on 12 September about free citizens no longer being threatened by a knock
               on the door at dead of night!]<note xml:id="e6879">Square brackets in
                  original.</note>
                </p>
            <p>11. By the following morning, when One plus Three Ministers met at the French Embassy
               under Dumas’s<note xml:id="e6883">Roland Dumas (*1922), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P15651">dodis.ch/P15651</ref>, French Foreign
                  Minister, 10.5.1988–28.3.1993.</note> slightly dishevelled chairmanship, further
               US/FRG work had produced the form of words which was eventually to become the text of
               the agreed minute annexed to the Treaty. One plus Three Ministers quickly agreed that
               they did not wish to hold out for the formulation at paragraph 9 (ii) above at the
               expense of delaying signature in Moscow. But Baker in particular was clear that if
               the Administration were to carry the treaty successfully on the Hill, something in
               writing would be necessary about the provisions on military activity in the former
               GDR after Soviet troop departure; oral assurances would not do. When we broke from
               the breakfast the preferred solution was an inspired question and answer at the press
               conference which Shevardnadze would pass to Genscher who would answer in terms of the
               latest agreed text; this would then be confirmed as a record of the exchange in the
               press conference by letter from Genscher to his five Two plus Four colleagues or,
               failing that, to the Three.</p>
            <p>12. Genscher and Baker went off to see Shevardnadze. The Russians then let it be
               known that the timetable for the morning’s meetings had reverted to the original
               plan. Two plus Four Ministers had a private session at the Octyabrskaya Hotel prior
               to the Plenary session there. It was then that Baker stumbled on the notion of an
               agreed minute, to be annexed to the treaty and signed in addition to it by all six
               Ministers. Slightly to everyone’s surprise this won Shevardnadze’s assent. By this
               time the German delegation were once more in a highly excitable state, Genscher’s
               Private Secretary, Frank Elbe<note xml:id="e6891">Frank Elbe (*1941), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57472">dodis.ch/P57472</ref>, Private Secretary of
                  Hans-Dietrich Genscher 1987–1992.</note>, being particularly disagreeable, and
               venting all kinds of nonsense about how close “some people” had come “to screwing it
               up”. The formal plenary session and the predictable speeches for the occasion
               followed without controversy. We broke to allow final preparations of the text for
               signature. At this point we moved from the sublime to the ridiculous. The German
               word-processor back-up went on the blink, thus delaying both German and French texts
               of the agreed minute. The American delegation, despite being 180 strong in Moscow,
               were apparently unable to produce a typewriter in the hotel that morning. I began to
               wonder about the wisdom of having conceded to the Americans the final textual work,
               the UK team having earned much credit throughout the session in Berlin and the early
               stages in Moscow with our Toshiba lap-top producing running updates of the texts in
               near real time around the table.</p>
            <p>13. Signature duly followed under Gorbachev’s benevolent eye. Bondarenko looked ten
               years younger on the instant. Champagne and congratulations were lavish. The final
               forty-eight hours were nevertheless instructive. They brought home for me that, with
               the arrival of German unity, Germany will not be simply the Federal Republic plus,
               but a different entity. Looking back on the whole process I see something of a thread
               running through: the early reluctance of the Germans to discuss politico-military
               issues at One plus Three, the bilateral concessions made at Stavropol
                  (<emph>pace</emph> Bob Blackwill’s valedictory at Carnegie, Zoellick sees that as
               essentially bilateral) the subsequent systematic ambiguity about what had been agreed
               there on the troop movement question (“verlegt” in German serving variously as
               “stationing”, “deployed” and “moved” depending on the day and the argument), the
                  <emph>fait accompli</emph> over the exclusion of SOFA/SA<note xml:id="e6899">Status of Forces Agreement/Supplementary Agreement (to the SOFA).</note> from
               application in the former GDR, the acrimony over the crossing the line issue at the
               last, Genscher’s unforthcoming answer at the press conference to the question about
               Allied forces in Berlin, and the general obtuseness and emotion on the German side
               faced with the assertion that an important Alliance interest might be at stake.</p>
            <p>14. I do not wish to exaggerate all this or to diminish the achievement, for the
               Germans and indeed for us all, that German unification represents. We have every
               reason to work within the Alliance as within the Community to maintain and if
               possible strengthen the underlying strategic Western solidarity. But as we embark on
               this renewed challenge from 3 October I already begin to feel as I look at our German
               partners that:</p>
            <p>‘You are not the same people who left that station</p>
            <p>Or who will arrive at any terminus …’<note xml:id="e6908">
