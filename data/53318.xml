            <p>1. <emph>Question.</emph> What guarantees will the Soviet Union seek to ensure that
               German unity will not become a threat to the security of other countries?</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Answer.</emph> The movement towards the unification of Germany – that is, of
               course, a historic event. It means the implementation of the legitimate, deepest
               aspirations of the German people. It draws a line under the postwar era in the life
               of Europe and at the same time determines the content of this process.</p>
            <p>The political and military structure of Europe created as the outcome of World War
               II, despite all its shortcomings during almost half a century, has provided stability
               and peace on the continent. A new, emerging European structure should at least have
               the same properties. This is an all-European task. All the interested states should
               make a productive contribution to its solution, though, of course, the four powers,
               including the Soviet Union, are endowed in this case with a special
               responsibility.</p>
            <p>The main thing, obviously, is to find such a military and political status for a
               united Germany which would not radically upset the balance of power. This, in our
               opinion, would be fully achievable if Germany becomes a non-aligned country in the
               military sense with the armed forces potential intended only for defense
               purposes.</p>
            <p>Another guarantee, the value of which cannot be overemphasized, is the coherence of
               the movement towards the unification of Germany with efforts to create all-European
               security structures.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>2. <emph>Question.</emph> How does the Soviet Union see the role of the national
               integrity of Germany in the political and military structure existing now on the
               European continent?</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
                    <emph>Answer.</emph> The unified Germany wouldn’t fit into the present military and
               political European structures without problems. These structures were built when the
               two German states were part of different alliances and not for a unified Germany.</p>
            <p>The prospect of German unification is an important incentive, giving us a chance to
               fundamentally reform the current structures of the European security – in effect, to
               recreate them. Anyway, like any serious work, it will take time and a transitional
               period. In any case, it would be a mistake if in the course of building German unity
               we destroy the existing security system without replacing it with a new one.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>3. <emph>Question.</emph> Could the Soviet Union, under any conditions accept the
               united Germany as a member of NATO?</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Answer.</emph> Membership of the united Germany in NATO is unacceptable for us,
               since this would mean a radical break-up of the current balance of power in Europe.
               From the Western side we expect the understanding of the impossibility of such an
               option. It is necessary to jointly seek other solutions that would not undermine
               anyone’s security. Such solutions are achievable if we retain the basis of reality
               and respect of our mutual interests.</p>
            <p>In searching for such solutions, we shouldn’t limit ourselves to the familiar
               recipes. For example, there was the idea of a double membership of the united Germany
               in NATO and the Warsaw Pact. I would like to highlight such an option once again,
               although someone in the West has tried to dismiss it out of hand. Though this option
               may seem non-standard, that does not mean that it is unrealistic. Anyway, one must
               understand the arguments of those who believe that the idea of “double membership”
               may not only help to find the solution for one of the most difficult questions
               arising in connection with the unification of Germany, but could instead be a
               practical step towards creating European security structures. The territory of
               Germany would turn into the testing ground for the constructive interaction of blocs,
               a place of their gradual diffusion. Generally, this is something to think about.
               Germany itself would not lose anything with such a decision.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>4. <emph>Question.</emph> How do you assess the role of the European Communities in
               the framework of the CSCE in the new conditions?</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Answer.</emph> The “Twelve” have always played a prominent role in determining
               the main directions of the development of the Helsinki process, they have often
               facilitated the search for mutually acceptable solutions and reasonable compromises.
               We hope that the EC member states will bring their political power and influence,
               together with the other participants in the all-European process, in the current
               rapidly developing situation in Europe to ensure its development in conditions of
               stability. We particularly appreciate the EC’s support of our initiative to convene a
               CSCE summit in 1990. We are ready for the most active cooperation with the “Twelve”
               in practical preparations for this meeting, providing a qualitatively new impetus to
               the development of the CSCE process as a whole.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>5. <emph>Question.</emph> How does the Soviet Union see the work of the Conference on
               Security and Cooperation in Europe under the new conditions?</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
                    <emph>Answer.</emph> Today it is already obvious that it is not only desirable, but
               necessary to maintain the existing momentum in the development of the all-European
               process. The question of the future of the CSCE process will undoubtedly be one of
               the central themes on the agenda of the European summit. A meaningful exchange of
               views on the options for European development would contribute to the formulation of
               agreed conceptual approaches and the formation of a future European community, taking
               into account both the ideas of Mikhail Gorbachev<note xml:id="e5433">Mikhail

               commonality of Europe”, as well as the views expressed by other countries.</p>
            <p>Many good ideas have been put forward on the formation of all-European structures. In
               addition to the well-known Soviet proposals for the establishment of the All-European
               Council, consisting of the heads of states, the Committee of Ministers of Foreign
               Affairs of the CSCE countries and the Center for the prevention of military threats,
               there are proposals from the FRG, Poland and Czechoslovakia. Thus, there is something
               to think over and to discuss, considering the interests of Europe, present and
               future.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>6. <emph>Question.</emph> How do the “2 + 4” talks affect the process of the
               development of the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe?</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Answer.</emph> There is a direct connection. The movement towards the united
               Germany should not hamper the building of the common European house and we believe it
               would be utterly unacceptable if it disturbs the balance of power and stability in
               Europe, calling into question the positive results achieved within the framework of
               the CSCE. On the contrary, the convergence and unification of the two Germanies are
               set to become an integral part of the broad efforts to establish a new way of
               European life based on peace and cooperation.</p>
            <p>Proceeding from this understanding, the Soviet side stands for discussing within the
               framework of the “Six” the issue of the synchronization of building German unity with
               the CSCE process. We share the approach of those states which believe that the
               results of the work of the “Six” should be considered and possibly approved at the
               meeting of the CSCE members at the highest level.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>7. <emph>Question.</emph> Will the Soviet Union as a participant of the “2 + 4” talks
               insist on addressing the issues affecting the interests of other European countries,
               including a peace settlement in Europe?</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Answer.</emph> The Soviet Union as a participant of the discussions of the
               “Six” is guided not only by its own national interests, but also by the broad
               interests of European security. Doing things differently would be irresponsible.
               Today, it is impossible for someone to build security at the expense of other
               countries, it could be relevant only if the interests of all European countries are
               taken into account.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>In the course of work specific questions will probably arise affecting the interests
               of countries that are not members of the “Six”. In our view, it should be possible to
               involve them in the discussions in the “Six” at corresponding stages.</p>
            <p>The building of the German unity brings a practical dimension into the question of
               the elaboration of an international legal settlement to draw a final line under the
               past war.</p>
            <p>The most correct form of such settlement would be a peace treaty or an equivalent
               document in which the issues relating to the military-political status, the question
               of borders etc., would find their solutions. We think that such a document could be
               worked out within the framework of the “Six” with the active participation of the two
               German states.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>8. <emph>Question.</emph> How do you see the role in the all-European process of
               military neutral countries such as Austria, Ireland and Sweden?</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Answer.</emph> We believe that any country can make an important contribution
               to the CSCE process as it has been conceived as a non-aligned structure with the
               decisions taken by consensus. Therefore, the voice of any country is essential. The
               three countries you mentioned, along with other neutral and non-aligned countries are
               actively involved in all-European cooperation and each of them has made a solid
               contribution, though in its own way, to its development. Now, when the confrontation
               between the countries belonging to the military blocs vanishes, the reconciliatory
               role of neutral countries, of course, is becoming less important, although it still
               remains valid. This has been confirmed in particular by the Conference on Economic
               Cooperation in Europe which took place in Bonn, where the draft of the final document
               was represented by the “N + N” group.</p>
            <p>Today, when the question of the necessity to create the new security structures has
               become extremely urgent, every country participating in the European process should
               contribute to this work. This concerns not only bloc countries but all the nations of
               the continent. Security is indivisible, and all the members of NATO and of the Warsaw
               Pact want it to be strengthened, as do militarily neutral countries like Austria,
               Ireland, and Sweden.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>9. <emph>Question.</emph> How do you see the development of relations between the
               USSR and the countries that are members of the European Communities within the
               framework of the political and economic cooperation in a changing Europe?</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Answer.</emph> The current changes in Europe are a good start to raise the
               political and economic cooperation between the USSR and the European Communities to a
               qualitatively new level.</p>
            <p>In the context of the ongoing rapprochement between the East and the West, we
               consider it possible and realistic to set a task that will focus our political
               dialogue with the European Communities on the gradual transition from a simple
               exchange of views, through a comparison of our positions to practical interaction and
               partnership in consolidating positive changes in Europe and throughout the world. It
               seems that the USSR and the “Twelve” could become co-authors of many specific ideas
               and steps towards the formation of the European community of the XXI century.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>The USSR-EC agreement on trade, commerce and economic cooperation is an example of a
               fundamentally new approach to the economic cooperation of Eastern and Western Europe,
               a kind of future outlook. It is a practical contribution where both sides work
               together to lay the economic foundation of the common European home. Obviously, it is
               time to think together about the establishment of some permanent all-European
               structures of economic cooperation which would help to reconcile the economies of the
               East and the West with a prospect of reaching a common European economic space from
               the Atlantic to the Urals.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>10.<emph> Question.</emph> Both Moscow and Dublin critically commented on the
               unrealized opportunities in Soviet-Irish relations. What could be done about this,
               and are there plans for a meeting at the level of foreign ministers to sign, for
               example, an agreement on cultural cooperation, following the understanding reached
               two years ago?</p>
            <p>
                    <emph>Answer.</emph> It must be recognized that for a long time our relations with
               Ireland have been given a sort of residual attention. Honestly speaking, we did not
               really feel that the Irish side sought to provide any real drive in its relations
               with the Soviet Union. With all this, there is little reason to talk about any kind
               of coolness or alienation in bilateral relations. Since their official establishment
               in 1973 there have been no acute or unpleasant problems between Dublin and Moscow. On
               the contrary, our countries have always respected each other. Another thing is
               important as well. There have always been a lot of similarities and even coincidences
               in our approaches towards the central problems of European and regional policy. We
               highly appreciate the contribution of Ireland to the all-European process, the
               settlement of regional conflicts and the UN peacekeeping activities.</p>
            <p>A new political era in world affairs, which started with Perestroika, opens up new
               opportunities for the development of Soviet-Irish relations on an equal and mutually
               beneficial basis. Mikhail Gorbachev’s visit to Ireland and his talks with Charles
                  Haughey<note xml:id="e5503">Charles Haughey (1925–2006), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P42316">dodis.ch/P42316</ref>, Prime Minister of
                  Ireland 10.3.1987–11.2.1992.</note> in Shannon on 2 April 1989 are considered by
               both sides to be the most important reference point characterizing the translation of
               the entire complex of bilateral relations into the phase of dynamic and constructive
               cooperation. It can be said with satisfaction that the results of the visit are quite
               successful and they are being implemented with regard to the deepening of the
               political dialogue between the two countries, the expansion of economic and cultural
               ties, and of parliamentary exchanges. A lot has already been done on these fronts,
               although, of course, this is only the beginning.</p>
            <p>It has been mutually agreed to include plans for Soviet-Irish contacts at the high
               and highest levels visits of prime minister Ch. Haughey and Foreign Minister G.
                  Collins<note xml:id="e5511">Gerry Collins (*1938), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57504">dodis.ch/P57504</ref>, Irish Minister for
                  Foreign Affairs 12.7.1989–11.2.1992.</note>. Both our countries are willing to
               have these visits, and preparations have already started. Today this is particularly
               important because of Irelands’ chairmanship in the EC, as Dublin enjoys the status of
               the capital of the integrating Western Europe in the current half-year. However,
               unfortunately, circumstances can just get the <emph>better of us</emph> sometimes. An
               extremely busy calendar of events requiring special attention on the part of the
               Soviet leadership does not make it possible to set the exact dates. To complete the
               picture, I would like to say that besides the visits we maintain other contacts with
               the Irish leadership. I had and I have opportunities to engage in dialogue with the
               Foreign Minister of Ireland either within the framework of the UN General Assembly,
               or other forums, including all-European forums.</p>
