               Berlin’s two major newspapers, Der Tagesspiegel. We will report more detailed
               comments in series of telegrams. In the meantime, a few impressions.</p>
            <p>2. Fogged in, with only intermittent misty sun and chill wind blowing, Berlin had a
               distinct hangover look, the crowds and masses of cars of the weekend were gone. So
               was the joyous atmosphere. Traffic was almost normal. There were only a few GDR cars
               and Kudamm crowds were only slightly heavier than usual. But Berlin authorities were
               anticipating that last weekend will usher in further rounds of the Berlin carnival,
               even if perhaps not as boisterous and emotional in future, and with smaller crowds –
               now that everyone in East Berlin is used to the idea that they can “get out”. Reality
               of limited housing, problem of getting a new job, lack of money, prospect of moving
               away from friends and family, as well as a kind of personal as opposed to political
               pride, appeared to be imposing sober second thoughts on many East Germans, even if
               the attractions of West Berlin were still a bit dazzling.</p>
            <p>3. Reality was also imposing its discipline on chaotic images of weekend. Although
               there are more and more holes in it, and although it has thus lost much of its
               malevolent psychological power, the Wall remains. Neither Germany nor Berlin have
               been re-united. Contrary to the popular press headlines of the weekend: “Berlin is at
               last a single city once more.” After the laissez-faire chaos of weekend, which acted
               as a welcome stabilizing safety valve, GDR authorities were slowly re-exerting
               control at the checkpoints, insisting on visas which, however, were being issued
               routinely with a minimum of delay. At Potsdamer Platz checkpoint, subdued and
               business-like East Germans could be seen patiently waiting in relatively short lines
               for documentation, and then trickling across the no-mans-land into West Berlin,
               almost as if it were normal practice. While movement of people east and west has been
               liberalized, nothing has changed for travellers west to east and, above all, the
               frontiers remain. Indeed, Soviet spokesmen have made respect for the existing
               frontier a <emph>sine qua non</emph> for Soviet acquiescence in developments. French
               interlocutor hailed victory of West in Cold War, not least due to Western solidarity,
               but USA general cautioned that from perspective of protecting powers, we were only at
               mid-point of a marathon, not end of the race, and the need for patience, coordination
               and firmness remained as great as ever.</p>
            <p>4. Significantly, the most powerful emotional symbol of division of Germany, the Wall
               at the Brandenburg gate, remains and attracts the fascinated interest of crowds and
               media crews. Krenz<note xml:id="e1931">Egon Krenz (*1937), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P54794">dodis.ch/P54794</ref>, General Secretary of
                  the SED 18.10.1989–3.12.1989 and Chairman of the GDR State Council
                  18.10.1989–6.12.1989.</note> has been making noises about opening this entry too,
               since he knows its value as a symbolic gesture and we expect that it too will become
               a new crossing point in near future.</p>
            <p>5. Perhaps most surprising aspect of what some perceive as the primitive beginnings
               of German reunification was the lack of violence and quintessential German
               orderliness of crowds. Despite an influx of 2.4 million visitors, order was
               maintained, with little vandalism or crime and few disturbances or injuries. Cars
               filed into city in orderly lines and parked in as orderly a fashion as possible. The
               crowds, like revellers who can scarcely believe their good fortune, remain
               good-natured, if boisterous. The only possible danger points emerged at Potsdamer
               Platz where crowd had reached critical mass and might have exploded had not East
               German border guards given up any pretense of control, and at the Brandenburg Gate
               where crowds climbing Wall were removed by West German police with the agreement of
               UK authorities for fear that one false step or an accidental slip might set off a
               riot.</p>
            <p>6. From our discussions, some consensus appeared to be emerging that trigger from
               historic 09 Nov event was announcement by GDR government spokesman Schabowski<note xml:id="e1941">Günter Schabowski (1929–2015), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P56902">dodis.ch/P56902</ref>, member of the SED
                  Politburo and spokesman of the GDR government 1989.</note> following Politburo
               meeting on 09 Nov that frontier was now open. Message was picked up first in West
               Berlin and was then relayed back to GDR by western media. Incredulous crowds began to
               gather at Wall and checkpoints, quickly reaching critical mass. Given a serious
               breakdown of lines of authority within GDR government, which extended to frontier
               guards as well, latter were not willing to oppose masses without orders and simply
               gave up. Once the first crowds surged westward, GDR authorities realized that to try
               to stem tide would be suicidal and very wisely let the situation go in order to blow
               off almost a half century’s pent-up steam.</p>
            <p>7. On the morning after, so to speak, Berlin was beginning to face up to implications
               of a more open frontier. Invasion of badly engineered East German cars had created
               massive pollution and traffic problems – all of which is anathema to the Greens at
               the best of times, and they are now an essential element in the city governing
               coalition with the SPD. The city could not be expected to continue its generous
               attitude to hordes of East Germans lacking hard currency. Fears and opposition to new
               arrivals over housing, jobs and social services are growing, not least since latest
               refugees, in contrast to young, well-trained professionals who had fled west via CSSR
               and Hungary, included heavy admixture of the dregs of East German society.
               Notwithstanding natural optimism and resilience of Berliners, the thought of who
               would pay for last week’s party (and how) was beginning to trouble many. As an
               example, Berlin banks which had financed the enormous demands for the 100 DM
               welcoming payment made to all East German newcomers on first arrival were already
               demanding that Bonn not only replace funds immediately but pay interest and extra
               costs of processing. The party, indeed, was over. But nothing on the other hand would
               ever be the same again in Berlin and in the Federal Republic, as well, of course, as
               in the East.</p>
