            <p>This is the draft of the “Final International Legal Settlement with Germany”,
               prepared in the light of agreements reached in Arkhyz.</p>
            <p>As it was agreed at the experts’ meeting of the “Six” held 19 July in Bonn (after the
               ministerial meeting in Paris), the Western participants and the Soviet side must
               exchange their drafts of the final document before 15 August in order to facilitate
               the work of the experts when they come to Berlin at the beginning of September to
               agree the final text of the said document.</p>
            <p>It would be advisable to hand our project to the rest of the “Six” participants as

               Northern Ireland, the United States of America and the French Republic,</p>
            <p>– realizing that the peoples of their states have been living in peace with each
               other since 1945;</p>
            <p>– taking into account the historical changes of recent time in Europe, which provide
               an opportunity to overcome its division;</p>
            <p>– taking into account the rights and responsibilities of the Four powers relating to
               Germany as a whole and to Berlin, as well as respective agreements and decisions of
               the Four powers taken during war and the post-war period;</p>
            <p>– determined, in accordance with their obligations under the Charter of the United
               Nations, to develop friendly relations among nations on the basis of respect for the
               principle of equal rights and self-determination of peoples, and to take other
               appropriate measures to strengthen universal peace;</p>
            <p>– referring to the principles and provisions of the CSCE Helsinki Final Act;</p>
            <p>– recognizing that these principles have laid a solid foundation for the
               establishment of a just and to secure a peaceful arrangement in Europe;</p>

               them in a treaty that is binding in accordance with international law.</p>

               action will be taken from its territory against anyone, either on its own or in
               alliance with other states, except in the exercise of the legitimate right of
               self-defense. There will also be no military activities of third States in its
               territory directed against anyone.</p>

               Northern Ireland, the United States of America and the French Republic take note of
               that Declaration and, for their part, confirm that they will be guided by the same

               not exceed in total the limit of 370 thousand persons for Ground, Air and Naval
               forces. Reductions to this level will be made over a maximum period of four years,

               to a certain level the military forces and weapons of each participant of
               negotiations.</p>
            <p>During the period of stay of the Soviet troops, which will not exceed 4 years from
               the date of entry into force of the aforementioned treaty, in the territory of the
               united Germany with the exception of the area of Greater Berlin, there should be no
               other foreign troops, as well as German troops integrated into NATO. The German
               territorial defense forces may be deployed there, including the Greater Berlin area.
               When the withdrawal of Soviet troops is completed, the said territory will remain
               free from the presence of any foreign troops. Neither will nuclear weapons and the
               means of their delivery be deployed there.</p>

               of Germany, excluding the movement of their troops located in the Western sectors of
               Berlin. The troops of the Soviet Union, for their part, will also not cross the
               line.</p>
            <p>8. With the entry in force of the final international legal settlement with Germany,
               the occupation regime of the western sectors of Berlin is terminated.</p>
            <p>At the same time, allied agreements on the Berlin air corridors, the Berlin control
               zone and the military transit via ground communications shall cease to have effect.
