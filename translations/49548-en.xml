               following the latter’s urgent request and, in T<add type="edition">[schirlich]</add>
               ’s words, by way of the GDR officially approaching the Swiss authorities with regard
               to today’s historic event.</p>
            <p>T<add type="edition">[schierlich]</add> appears distinctly “dépassé par les
               évènements”. He begins by delivering the attached memo<note xml:id="e1410">Memo of
                  the Embassy of the GDR in Bern, 10 November 1989, <ref
                     target="https://dodis.ch/52350">dodis.ch/52350</ref>.</note>. At the time of
               his intervention (late Friday afternoon), both the regulations set down there and
                  T<add type="edition">[schirlich]</add> ’s remark that the Wall invariably
               persists, and continues to function as a border, are in part already obsolete. Two
               aspects of T<add type="edition">[schirlich]</add> ’s in part somewhat confused
               deliberations, however, deserve attention:</p>
            <p>– Today, a great number of Swiss citizens inquired at his embassy about options for
               informal departure from the GDR to Switzerland (for relatives etc.) and similar
               options for travelling into the GDR, respectively. GDR authorities assumed that the
               existing visa regulations between the GDR and Switzerland continue to apply.</p>
            <p>– T<add type="edition">[schirlich]</add> appears to be inquiring, although in a very
               hedged manner, whether Switzerland would lend support to a “now reformed” GDR, “since
               a lot of substance will be lost due to the new travel regulations”.</p>
            <p>Adhering to the announcement issued today by the press and information service, I
               answered T<add type="edition">[schirlich]</add> that we welcome the opening of the
               GDR border as a step towards freedom and democracy.</p>
            <p><emph>To be determined:</emph> Should and must the Swiss visa policy in relation to
               the GDR be revised in light of the most recent events? This also in light of the
               notification just in from our embassy in Berlin (T<add type="edition">[elex]</add> 72
               of 10.11. in attachment<note xml:id="e1439">Telex No. 72 from the Swiss Embassy in
                  East Berlin, 10 November 1989, <ref target="https://dodis.ch/52351"
                     >dodis.ch/52351</ref>.</note>), which is likewise being swamped with
               inquiries.</p>
