               <emph>Introduction</emph>
            </p>
            <p>1. Unification is moving swiftly. The 2+4 talks on external aspects have begun in
               earnest.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>Line to Take (Unclassified)</emph>
            </p>
            <p>2. – Glad 2+4 process underway. Constructive and conciliatory Ministerial meeting on
               5 May agreed agenda for future work and pattern of future meetings.</p>
            <p>– Much to do. Can now see way to completing work on external aspects in harmony with
               internal unification process.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>

               <note xml:id="e5559">Eduard Shevardnadze (1928–2014), <ref
                     target="https://dodis.ch/P54603">dodis.ch/P54603</ref>, Minister of Foreign
                  Affairs of the Soviet Union 2.7.1985–26.12.1990.</note>
               <emph>Proposal to Decouple Internal and External Aspects?</emph>
            </p>
            <p>– We agree with Chancellor Kohl<note xml:id="e5567">Helmut Kohl (1930–2017), <ref
                     target="https://dodis.ch/P31852">dodis.ch/P31852</ref>, Chancellor of the FRG
                  1.10.1982–27.10.1998.</note>. Would be undesirable (see para 14 below), to
               decouple internal and external aspects of unification. Aim to complete in the same
               timeframe. Significant that Soviet Union now accepts that unification will and should
               proceed.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>4. Will a Unified Germany be in NATO?</emph>
            </p>
            <p>– Western countries, including the FRG, believe that a united Germany must be in
               NATO. So do East European members of the Warsaw Pact. A neutral or non-aligned
               Germany would not contribute to stability or security in Europe.</p>
            <p>– Principle I of Helsinki Final Act sets out the right of every country to decide
               whether or not to be a member of a military alliance.</p>
            <p>– But no interest in exploiting the situation to the Soviet Union’s disadvantage. Aim
               is to find a durable solution which takes account of others’ legitimate concerns.</p>
            <p>– We are considering bilaterally (and in the 2+4) how such concerns can be met.
               Likely to include special transitional arrangements for territory of former GDR.</p>
            <p>– Soviet Union must recognise that other developments in Europe (strengthened CSCE,
               progress on arms control, NATO changing) are helping to meet its legitimate
               concerns.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>5. Incorporation of GDR in EC?</emph>
            </p>
            <p>– Want to see GDR integrated into EC as fully, quickly, smoothly and transparently as
               possible. Have endorsed Commission’s framework for this process. Look to them and
               FRG/GDR to keep Council fully in picture.</p>
            <p>– Basically, see EC <emph>acquis</emph> in all areas applying to ex-GDR territory
               from unification. But some temporary derogations may be needed where EC standards
               cannot be met at once (e.g. environment).</p>
            <p>– Important that measures taken under German economic and monetary union before
               political union are aligned with EC law.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>6. German Borders (Especially Border with Poland)?</emph>
            </p>
            <p>– Clearly important that this issue should be settled definitively.</p>
            <p>– Welcome agreement among Poland, GDR and FRG that Poland’s western border
               (Oder-Neisse line) should be enshrined in a treaty. Poland invited to 2 + 4
               Ministerial in Paris in July, when borders will be on agenda. Poles will also attend
               the official level meeting which will prepare for this.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>7. Position of Berlin?</emph>
            </p>
            <p>– Western protecting powers and Soviet Union will need to discuss with the Germans
               how the Four Power regime in Berlin might best be wound up. Agreed that this will be
               on the 2+4 agenda.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>8. Risk of Fourth Reich?</emph>
            </p>
            <p>– No. FRG has changed fundamentally since Nazi period. Forty years of well
               established liberal democracy. A close partner and ally.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>9. Right of Others to Have a Say?</emph>
            </p>
            <p>– Internal aspects of unification are primarily a matter for the Germans themselves.
               We have always supported their right of self-determination on a democratic basis.</p>
            <p>– Four Powers have rights and responsibilities relating to Berlin and Germany as a
               whole. But the establishment of the 2+4 framework is not meant to exclude others or
               intrude upon decisions for other fora. Relevant issues are discussed in e.g. NATO and
               EC.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>10. Role of CSCE?</emph>
            </p>
            <p>– Outcome of 2+4 should be laid before CSCE summit.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>11. Future of Soviet Forces in GDR?</emph>
            </p>
            <p>– Yet to be agreed. Primarily a matter between the FRG and Soviet Union but FRG, as
               NATO member, have indicated their intention to consult closely with allies. But it is
               envisaged that there might be a transitional period when some Soviet forces remained
               temporarily in what is now the GDR, after unification. We have no wish to cause
               instability through sudden change.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>
               <emph>Background (Restricted – may be drawn on with trusted contacts)</emph>
            </p>
            <p/>
            <p>12. The first 2+4 Ministerial took place in Bonn on 5 May, preceded by preparation at
               Political Director level. Future meetings are planned for East Berlin in June, Paris
               in July (when the Poles will attend), Moscow in September and then Washington and
               London. Political Directors also met on 22 May and will meet again on 9 June and,
               probably, 4 July.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>13. The agenda agreed for future talks is:</p>
            <p>– Borders</p>
            <p>– Politico-military issues, bearing in mind approaches for suitable security
               structures in Europe</p>
            <p>– Berlin</p>
            <p>– Final settlement under international law and termination of the Four Power rights
               and responsibilities</p>
            <p/>
            <p>14. The main development in Bonn on 5 May was Shevardnadze’s proposal that the
               internal aspects of unification (which could be settled quickly by the Germans) and
               the external aspects (which should be subject to a transition period during which 4
               power rights would be continued) should be de-coupled. The Germans have since firmly
               rejected this proposal. It would prolong the Soviet locus in German affairs: continue
               singularisation of Germany by limiting her sovereignty after unity: and create false
               parallelism between the presence of Allied and Soviet forces in Germany. The issue
               was not raised at the 2+4 official level meeting on 22 May.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>15. The Russians also aim to secure an outcome which restricts the freedom of German
               action such as limits on the <emph>Bundeswehr</emph>, united Germany not (not) in
               NATO integrated structure etc.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>16. The Ministerial meeting in June is likely to focus on structure of a final
               settlement including ending of provisional nature of borders, Berlin and termination
               of Quadripartite Rights and Responsibilities. Politico-military issues are also
               likely to be aired. But the Western Four are determined that the 2+4 should not (not)
               take decisions on issues which are the responsibility of other fora, e.g. CSCE, CFE,
               SNF and NATO. There may be some cross reference to these. But 2+4 should act as no
               more than a “post-box”.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>17. Russian concerns might be met by referring to developments in these other fora
               and to acts of German self-determination such as over NBC weapons.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>18. Internally unification is moving swiftly. The FRG/GDR State Treaty providing for
               economic, monetary and social union was initialled on 18 May and has passed to the
               two German parliaments for ratification. Target date for GEMU<note xml:id="e5677"
                  >German Economic and Monetary Union.</note> itself is 2 July. The signs are that
               the GDR may move towards state unity with the FRG by the turn of the year with Kohl
               now going for all-German elections in December or January, dropping the FRG elections
               scheduled for 2 December.</p>
            <p/>
            <p>19. The Western Four are taking care to keep NATO and EC partners fully briefed both
               multilaterally and individually. The Dutch and Italians have been particularly
               sensitive.</p>
            <p/>
