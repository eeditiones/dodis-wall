            <p n="1">According to the summing up of our talks with the GDR delegation in Copenhagen
               on the 3<hi>rd</hi> of this month<note xml:id="e6109">The Israeli Embassy in
                  Copenhagen to the Director-General of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, 3
                  July 1990,<idno> Israel State Archives P4731/2</idno>

                  1990, <idno>Israel State Archives P4731/2</idno>. The telegram of 6 July 1990 is
                  not in the file.</note> and the 6<hi>th</hi> of this month we can conclude:</p>
            <p>1. The fate of our material claims from the GDR is in the hands of the FRG, in view
               of the monetary union of the two Germanies (which came into force on the 1<hi>st</hi>
               of this month) and the expected political union between them towards the end of this
               year.</p>
            <p>2. The GDR delegation refuses to mention the “Luxembourg Agreements” of 1952 (in the
               joint announcement on the establishment of diplomatic relations between Israel and
               the GDR) as the basis for talks between experts from both countries to discuss the
               material claims of the Israeli government from the GDR government. This refusal was
               apparently coordinated in advance with the authorities in the FRG who are balking at
               the financial implications involved.</p>
            <p>3. In negotiations with the FRG it will be possible to reach agreement on the payment
               of certain sums, so long as they are not called “reparations”. We can also conclude
               that we are talking about much smaller sums than would be expected according to the
               “Luxembourg agreements”. (As we know, there is no explicit reference to the GDR in
               the agreements, only implied, to commit itself to pay a third of the reparations
               while the FRG took on itself to pay two-thirds).</p>
            <p>4. The person who can decide in favour of reparations is apparently Chancellor
                  Kohl<note xml:id="e6134">Helmut Kohl (1930–2017), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P31852">dodis.ch/P31852</ref>, Chancellor of the FRG
                  1.10.1982–27.10.1998.</note>. It is proposed to initiate with him a meeting on the
               level of the finance ministers or alternatively, to send him a letter signed by Prime
               Minister Shamir<note xml:id="e6140">Yitzhak Shamir (1915–2012), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P54271">dodis.ch/P54271</ref>, Prime Minister of
                  Israel 20.10.1986–13.7.1992.</note>. A meeting cannot take place before the middle
               of August. A letter can be given to him immediately.</p>
            <p>Preliminary feelers have been sent out by our Ambassador in Bonn who has suggested to
               us stages for action. At the same time it is proposed that you should meet with your
               colleague in the FRG Foreign Ministry<note xml:id="e6148">Jürgen Sudhoff (*1935),
                     <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57384">dodis.ch/P57384</ref>, Secretary of State
                  in the Foreign Ministry of the FRG 22.4.1987–17.1.1991.</note>, in continuation of
               the consultations that you already had, on this subject, on 26 May of this year.</p>
            <p/>
            <p n="1">
               <emph>The questions before us</emph>
            </p>
            <p>
               <emph>1. Is the FRG interested in our establishing diplomatic relations with the
                  GDR?</emph>
            </p>
            <p>The assumption is that the answer is positive, since it will be a form of giving a
               stamp of approval to the reunification. Their agreement to the establishment <add type="edition">[of relations]</add> was received by Foreign Minister Arens<note xml:id="e6165">Moshe Arens (1925–2019), <ref target="https://dodis.ch/P57439">dodis.ch/P57439</ref>, Israeli Foreign Minister 22.12.1988–11.6.1990.</note>
               in his meetings with the FRG leaders in Bonn (before the elections in the GDR) and
               our Ambassador in Bonn received a hint confirming this from the minister of state in
               Kohl’s office who said “that he would prefer that the FRG embassy in Israel should
               also represent the GDR.”</p>
            <p>2. <emph>I</emph>
               <emph>s it politically wise to establish relations with a state that will be
                  swallowed up by the FRG in a few months’ time</emph> while it flatly refuses to
               bear its part in paying reparations to Israel (as defined as fulfilling its part in
               the absorption of Holocaust survivors from Germany and other countries under Nazi
               occupation during WWII)? As we know, the East German delegation proposed including a
               paragraph in the joint declaration on the establishment of relations saying: that
               Israel and the GDR have decided to hold a meeting of their experts to discuss
               material contributions. If we insist it will say “Israel’s material demands from the
               GDR connected with victims of the Holocaust, no later than 30 days after the date of
               signature on the establishment of relations.”</p>
            <p/>
            <p n="1">
               <emph>The advantages of establishing relations</emph>
            </p>
            <p>– An achievement for Israeli foreign policy <emph>towards the PLO and the Arab
                  state</emph>s which have enjoyed the political and military support of the GDR for
               nearly 40 years. Now that state is turning against them by establishing relations
               with Israel and by publicly and definitively disassociating itself from the UN
               resolution which condemned Zionism and by condemning terrorism.</p>
            <p>– Setting up a framework for negotiations on reparations which creates a dynamic,
               which in itself will continue afterwards in negotiations with the FRG. (It should be
               remembered that the West German chancellor has declared that he will honour all the
               financial commitments of the GDR after the reunification of both the Germanies).</p>
            <p/>
            <p n="1">
               <emph>The disadvantages of establishing relations</emph>
            </p>
            <p>– Giving a “stamp of approval” to the GDR towards their political union with the FRG,
               without paying its share of the “reparations” as we would expect in accordance with
               the “Luxembourg Agreements”.</p>
            <p>– Accepting the text proposed by the GDR delegation, after they have told us that it
               has no intention of basing the negotiations on the “Luxembourg Agreements”, could be
               interpreted as agreement on our part to the GDR’s refusal to bind the FRG to
               negotiate with us on the basis of those agreements.</p>
            <p>– It is not worthwhile, from a practical point of view, to establish relations with a
               state that will not exist in a few months, since in any case we are not talking about
               setting up diplomatic representations.</p>
            <p/>
            <p n="1">
               <emph>To sum up,</emph> the question is purely political. Negotiations on the
               reparations (proportion, amount, framework) will in any case be held with the
               FRG.</p>
            <p>If we decide in favour of establishing relations, we should act to carry this out as
               soon as the attitude of the FRG becomes clear (from the director-general of the MFA
               in Bonn) or from Chancellor Kohl. Since a meeting with him could only take place over
               a month from now, it is preferable to send him a letter, and the reply to it may be
               received earlier.</p>
